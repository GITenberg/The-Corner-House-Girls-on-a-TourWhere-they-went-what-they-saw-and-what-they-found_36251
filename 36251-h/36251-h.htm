<h1>THE CORNER HOUSE GIRLS ON A TOUR</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—A RED LETTER DAY INDEED</h2>
<p>
There was a deal of bustle and a twittering like
an eager flock of sparrows in the big kitchen of the
old Corner House, which stood facing Main Street
in Milton, but with its long side and rear yard and
garden running far back on Willow Street.
</p>
<p>
The four Kenway girls had the room all to
themselves at this early hour on Saturday morning,
for Mrs. MacCall and Aunt Sarah Maltby had
not yet come downstairs, while Linda, the maid,
had deserted the kitchen and pantry altogether
for the time being.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, the eldest and most sedate of the sisters,
was filling sandwiches at the dresser—and such a
variety as there was of them!
</p>
<p>
Chicken, with mayonnaise and a lettuce leaf;
pink ham cut thin and decorated with little golden
dabs of mustard; peanut butter sandwiches; nut
and cheese sandwiches, the filling nestling in a
salad leaf, too; tuna fish, with narrow slices of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
red, red Spanish peppers decorating it; and of
course sardines, carefully split and laid between
soda crackers. What picnic lunch would be complete
without sardines?
</p>
<p>
Agnes, the next oldest to Ruth and the beauty
of the family, was slicing bread as exactly as
though it were a problem in geometry and in such
quantity that Tess declared it looked as though
they were to feed an army.
</p>
<p>
Tess herself was seriously attending to the boiling
of two dozen eggs in a big saucepan.
</p>
<p>
“Though why you need to watch ’em so closely
I can’t see,” complained Agnes. “There are
other things you might be doing when there is so
<em>much</em> to do—goodness knows! Those eggs won’t
get away.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” joined in Dot, the youngest of the Corner
House girls, and quite seriously, too. “No. It
isn’t like boiling lobsters.”
</p>
<p>
“Right, Dottums,” chuckled Agnes, recovering
from her vexation immediately. “Eggs are an
entirely different kind of shellfish.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the little girl, explaining, “Mrs.
Adams boiled some raw lobsters the other day, and
one hopped right out of the pot on to the floor
and started for the door—it really did!”
</p>
<p>
“Oo-ee!” gasped Tess, attracted for a moment
from the bobbing eggs by this statement. “The
poor thing!”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s a poor thing—Mrs. Adams?” asked
Ruth, laughing gayly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, no,” said Tess, who was nothing if not
tender-hearted. “The lobster.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” exclaimed Agnes. “Do you
s’pose it hurts a lobster to be boiled?”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Why</em> doesn’t it?” demanded Tess, promptly.
</p>
<p>
“’Cause it has a shell,” ventured Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Why—because they always <em>do</em> boil them,” said
Agnes, rather at a loss for an answer to Tess’
question.
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes they broil them,” said the oldest
sister, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“Well, they’re used to it, anyway,” declared
Agnes, with conviction.
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t believe anybody could get used to
being boiled,” observed Tess, slowly. “Look at
Sammy Pinkney.”
</p>
<p>
“Where?” demanded Agnes, jumping. “I
hope that horrid child isn’t coming over so early.
I hoped we’d get away without having him
around.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” murmured Dot. “You know he’s
just got over the scarlet fever.”
</p>
<p>
“But he hasn’t got over being a nuisance,” declared
the older girl.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t mean that Sammy was really here—to
look at,” explained the serious Tess. “I
meant—I meant——”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what <em>did</em> you mean?” asked Agnes, who
was inclined to be impatient.
</p>
<p>
“She meant, ‘consider Sammy,’ didn’t you,
Tessie?” suggested Ruth, kindly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why—yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Were you taking him for an example?”
cried Agnes. “But Sammy hasn’t ever been
boiled—although maybe he ought to have been.”
</p>
<p>
“No; he hasn’t been boiled,” said the serious
Tess, still watching the eggs bobbing in the boiling
water. “But he’s punished lots of times—at
school, I mean. And he doesn’t seem to get used
to it. He hollers just as loud now as the first
time I ever heard him.”
</p>
<p>
“Did the lobster holler?” chuckled Agnes.
“Did it, Dot?”
</p>
<p>
But Dot—who was not allowed to “mess in”
with the lunch—had found another subject for consideration.
She had been looking at Ruth, dexterously
opening a second can of sardines. Now,
when the cover was laid back and the oil drained
off, the smallest girl pointed a dimpled finger at
the contents of the can.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, honey?” asked Ruth, smiling
down at the serious face of the fairy-like Dot.
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Ruthie,” said Dot, wonderingly, “I was
only thinking if that middle fish wanted to turn
over, what a lot of trouble it would have!”
</p>
<p>
Amid the laughter of the two older girls at this,
the door banged open and a boy with a mop of
flaxen hair—a regular “whitehead” and a football
cut at that—burst into the room.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me, girls! aren’t you ready yet?”
he demanded. “And it’s half-past seven.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
“The eggs are,” Tess declared, the first to
speak, for she had not been laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Well, then,” said the boy, “you and I, Tess,
will just take the eggs and go.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Neale O’Neil? Won’t
your horse stand?” drawled Agnes, tossing her
head.
</p>
<p>
“We would have been ready long ago if it had
not been for you, Neale,” said Ruth, promptly.
</p>
<p>
“How’s that? I’ve been up since five. And
the car’s right here at the side gate. Cracky!
it’s a scrumptious auto, girls. I don’t believe
there ever was a finer.”
</p>
<p>
“When our Mr. Howbridge does anything, he
always does it right,” proclaimed Tess, giving up
the guardianship of the eggs to Ruth. “And Mr.
Howbridge had the car built for us.”
</p>
<p>
“But we wouldn’t ever have had it,” put in
Dot, eager to tell all she knew, “if Mrs. Eland
and Miss Pepperill hadn’t given us the money
’cause we found their Uncle Lemon Aden’s
money.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, goodness!” gasped Tess. “<em>Lem-u-el</em>,
Dot!”
</p>
<p>
But Dot ignored the correction. “It was
awfully nice of them to give us the car because we
found the fortune in our garret.”
</p>
<p>
“Lots <em>you</em> did towards finding it,” chuckled
Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know why I didn’t help find it!”
cried the smallest Corner House girl, indignantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
“I saw it first—so there! I opened the book it
was hid in and I thought it was pitchers.”
</p>
<p>
“Say! that isn’t getting us anywhere,” began
the boy again. “Can’t you hurry? Just think!
the first ride in your car!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t remind me,” gasped Agnes, cutting a
crooked slice. “My nerves are all jumping now
like—like a <em>delightful toothache</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“Glory! listen to her,” laughed Neale. “But
say, Miss Ruthiford <em>Ten</em>-ways, why do you say
that it is my fault that you are not all ready?”
</p>
<p>
“Because we have to put up lunch enough to
satisfy your appetite,” said Ruth, running cold
water on the eggs from the open faucet.
</p>
<p>
“Well! I like that!” said Neale.
</p>
<p>
“I fancy you will, sonny,” said Agnes, looking
at him slyly. “There are lots of goodies in it.”
</p>
<p>
“Now run and get your hats and wraps, children,”
commanded Ruth seizing the last two slices
of bread Agnes had cut. “That will do, Aggie.
Leave a little bread for the folks to eat to-day
while we’re gone. <em>That</em> basket is all packed,
Neale, and you may take it out and put it in the
tonneau.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” gasped Agnes, clasping her hands.
“Doesn’t that sound fine?”
</p>
<p>
“What sounds fine!” asked her boy chum, surreptitiously
putting the last crumb of a broken
sandwich he had found into his mouth.
</p>
<p>
“The way Ruth said ‘tonneau.’ So—so
<em>Frenchy</em> and <em>automobily</em>!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, Aggie!” gasped Tess, in amazement, before
following Dot out of the kitchen, “you’re
making up words just like Dot does.”
</p>
<p>
“I feel like making up words,” laughed Agnes,
who had been “crazy for a car” for months and
months! “We’ll all be talking about ‘tonneaus,’
and ‘carbureters,’ and ‘gas,’ and ‘wiring,’ and ‘differentials,’
and——”
</p>
<p>
“And ‘equilaterals,’ and ‘isosceles triangles,’
and all that,” scoffed Neale. “You’ll know a hot
lot about an automobile, Agamemnon.”
</p>
<p>
“Come, young man!” exclaimed Ruth, tartly,
for she was very exact with boys, feeling sure that
she did not approve of them—much, “suppose you
take the basket out to the car—and these wraps—and
this coffee—and the little nursery icebox with
the milk bottles—and——”
</p>
<p>
“Hold on! Hold on!” yelled Neale O’Neil.
“What do you think I have—as many arms as a
spider? I can’t do it all in one trip.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you might make a beginning,” suggested
Ruth. “Come, Aggie. Don’t moon there all day.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not,” said her next youngest sister.
“I’m thinking.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the difference?” demanded Neale, filling
his arms with several of the things indicated
by Ruth and making for the door.
</p>
<p>
“I was thinking,” said Agnes, quite seriously
for her, “what a difference <em>this</em> is from what we
were before we came to Milton and the old Corner
House to live.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
Neale had gone out. Ruth looked at her with
softer eyes. Ruth was not exactly pretty, but she
had a very sweet face. Everybody said so. Now
she looked her understanding at Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I know, dear—I know,” she said, in her low,
full, sweet voice. “This is like another world.”
</p>
<p>
“Or a dream,” said Agnes. “Do—do you suppose
we’ll ever wake up, Ruthie, and find out it’s
all been make-believe?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth laughed outright at that and went over and
kissed her. “Don’t let your imagination run
away with you,” the older sister said. “It is all
real—very real indeed. What could be more real
than an automobile—and of our very own?”
</p>
<p>
Dot came dancing into the room hugging a doll
in her arms and cheerfully humming a school
song.
</p>
<p>
“There!” exclaimed Agnes, coming out of the
clouds, “I suppose that disreputable Alice-doll has
got to go along. It does look awful.”
</p>
<p>
Dot stopped her song at once and her lips
pouted.
</p>
<p>
“She <em>isn’t</em> dis—disreput’ble—she isn’t!” she
cried, stormily. “She’s only sick. How would
<em>you</em> like it, Aggie Kenway, if you’d been buried
alive—<em>and</em> with dried apples—and had had your
complexion spoiled?”
</p>
<p>
Dot was usually the most peaceful of mortals;
but Agnes had touched a sore spot.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind; you shall take her, love,” Ruth
said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
“I suppose if we want to go off on a real tour
by and by—this coming vacation—Dot’ll have to
lug that Alice-doll,” grumbled Agnes. “Suppose
we meet nice people at some of the hotels we stop
at, and other little girls have dolls? Dot’s will
look as though she came from Meadow Street.”
Meadow Street was in a poor section of Milton.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care,” grumbled Dot; “she’s going.”
</p>
<p>
“She ought to go a hospital first,” declared
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Who ought to go to a hospital?” demanded
Neale, coming in again.
</p>
<p>
“My Alice-doll, Neale,” cried Dot, running to
him, sure of sympathy—of a kind, at least.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the boy, “why not? If folks go to
hospitals and get cured, why not dolls?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale O’Neil!” gasped Dot, hugging her
cherished doll closer.
</p>
<p>
“Just think how nice Mrs. Eland was to folks
in her hospital,” went on Neale, his eyes twinkling.
“And Doctor Forsyth. A hospital is a
mighty fine place.”
</p>
<p>
“But—but what would they do to my Alice-doll?”
asked the smallest girl, seriously.
</p>
<p>
“Suppose they should give her a new complexion?
Make her quite well again? Wouldn’t
that be worth while?”
</p>
<p>
Dot held the really dreadful looking doll away
from her and gazed with loving eyes upon the
wreck of her former pink and white beauty.
</p>
<p>
“She is just as—as <em>dear</em> to me as ever she was,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
she sighed. “But I s’pose her complexion is
muddy—and her nose is flattened a little—and her
lips aren’t red any more--and her eyes are washed
out. But—but are you sure they won’t hurt her?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to find a hospital where they agree
not to hurt,” said Neale seriously.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Now</em> you’ve got yourself in a mess, Neale
O ‘Neil,” whispered Agnes. “She’ll never let you
rest.”
</p>
<p>
But the boy only grinned at her. Tess came
back. Ruth brought the hats of Agnes and herself
and their outer wraps. Everything that they
could possibly need for the day’s outing was gathered
together and taken out to the big, shiny,
seven-passenger touring car that stood gloriously
in the morning sunshine before the Willow Street
door of the old Corner House.
</p>
<p>
Tom Jonah, the old Newfoundland dog, and the
guardian of the premises, evidently desired to accompany
the merry party; but Ruth vetoed that,
although he might have ridden in the front seat
with Neale.
</p>
<p>
“And I’m going to ride there myself,” declared
Agnes, firmly. “I’ve got to learn to run this car
right away. If Neale could learn, and get a
license, <em>I</em> can. By the way, Neale, where is your
license?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ve got it with me,” returned the boy.
“D’ you want me to have it pasted on the back of
my coat?”
</p>
<p>
“Tom Jonah must stay at home—and the kittens, too,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
said Tess, looking at the troop of cats
and kittens lingering about the side porch, waiting
for their morning meal.
</p>
<p>
“And Billy Bumps,” added Dot, referring to
the solemn old goat grazing on the drying green.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Rufus, the black factotum of the Corner
House, came up from the garden, grinning widely
at them.
</p>
<p>
“Don’ yo’ chillun run down nothin’—nor run <em>up</em>
nothin’—w’ile yo’ is gone. I dunno ‘bout dat contraption.
Ah hopes yo’ git back widout more’n a
dozen laigs broke.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, Uncle Rufus!” cried Agnes.
“What do you think we are—centipedes?”
</p>
<p>
“Dunno nottin’ ‘bout dem ’er,” declared the old
colored man, chuckling. “Don’t hab center-pigs
in Virginny, whar I done come from. Dey uses
razorbacks fo’ de mos’ part in makin’ po’k.”
</p>
<p>
The car started amid a gale of laughter at this.
Mrs. MacCall waved her cap from an open second
story window. Some of the neighbors took a deep
interest in their departure, too. It was certainly
a fact that the Corner House girls had suddenly
become of much importance since it was known
that they had a car.
</p>
<p>
Ruth and the others looked up at Aunt Sarah
Maltby’s windows at the front of the house as the
car jounced delightfully across the tracks on Main
Street. But the old lady kept her curtains drawn.
She would not even look out at them.
</p>
<p>
They sped along so easily, the strong springs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
and shock-absorbers taking the jar at the crossings,
that even Ruth sighed ecstatically. Agnes
murmured:
</p>
<p>
“<em>This</em> is life. Oh, Neale! it’s the most delightful
way to travel.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it better than riding horses in a circus,
Neale?” demanded Tess, from the tonneau.
</p>
<p>
Neale laughed. He had been circus born and
bred, and the little girls still believed that such a
life must be one round of pleasure and excitement.
They never could understand why Neale
had run away from Twomley &amp; Sorber’s Herculean
Circus and Menagerie.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Agnes, the volatile, thought of another
thing. “Oh, me! Oh, my!” she cried.
“What ever should we do?”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! what’s the matter with you now?”
demanded her older sister.
</p>
<p>
“Suppose our auto should be stolen like Mr.
Collinger’s!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say that, Aggie!” wailed Tess.
</p>
<p>
“They couldn’t steal our auto,” declared Dot,
with emphasis.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” asked Neale, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“’Cause Tom Jonah wouldn’t let ’em,” said the
smallest girl.
</p>
<p>
“Then we should have brought Tom Jonah with
us,” Agnes said. “We’ll have to let him watch
the car all the time.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Collinger’s car was taken right away from
the front of the County Court House. Those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
thieves were bold,” said Ruth. “I heard Mr.
Howbridge say that there was something behind
that affair. He doubts if the car was stolen by
any common thieves.”
</p>
<p>
“Common or uncommon,” cried Agnes, “we
don’t want ours stolen!”
</p>
<p>
“Better set a watch at the garage door at
night,” chuckled Neale.
</p>
<p>
They were out in the country now and had entered
a smooth, but “woodsy,” road that passed
through a rather thick forest. The road was very
narrow in places and there were only a few houses
along the track for some miles.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly they sighted just ahead a basket
phaeton and a brown, fat pony hitched to it.
Neale slowed down quickly, for the turnout was
standing still. The driver was a middle-aged
woman with a good many fussy looking ribbons in
her bonnet and otherwise dressed quite gaily.
The fat brown pony was standing still, flicking flies
with his tail and wagging his ears comfortably.
He was in the very middle of the road and by no
possibility could the car be steered around the
turnout.
</p>
<p>
The woman looked around at the car and its
passengers and her face displayed a most exasperated
expression.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what you’ll do!” she cried, in a
rather shrill voice. “I can’t make him budge.
He’s been standing here this way for fifteen minutes,
and sometimes he balks for hours!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—WHAT MRS. HEARD HEARD</h2>
<p>
“Can’t you back, Neale?” asked Ruth Kenway,
doubtfully. “We really don’t want to stay here
all day.”
</p>
<p>
“Or wait upon the pleasure of a ridiculous beast
like that,” snapped Agnes, more than a little exasperated
herself.
</p>
<p>
The woman looked around again. She had a
pleasant face, and Tess smiled at her. Tess knew
that the lady must feel a good deal worse than <em>they</em>
did about it.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know how ridiculous he is,” said the
woman, hopelessly. “He may start any minute;
then again he may stay here until he gets hungry.
And he’s only just eaten his breakfast.”
</p>
<p>
“He looks as if he’d live as long without eating
as a camel can go without drinking,” chuckled
Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“It’s no laughing matter,” protested Agnes.
“We want to get somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t want to get somewhere worse than
<em>I</em> do, my dear,” said the woman, with a sigh.
“And only think! I have sat behind this pony
<em>hours and hours</em> during the past ten years.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can’t—can’t he be cured?” asked Tess, doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“He’s a real pretty pony, <em>I</em> think,” said Dot.
</p>
<p>
“‘Handsome is as handsome does,’ Mrs. Mac
would say,” Ruth declared. “Is there no way of
turning, Neale?” she repeated.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see how. We don’t want to scratch the
car all up in those bushes and on those stumps.
And if we back to where the road is wider we’ll
have to back for half a mile.”
</p>
<p>
“A trolley car is lots better than an auto, then,”
declared Dot, with conviction.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Dottie! how can you say that?” cried
Tess, in utter disapproval.
</p>
<p>
“’Cause if it gets stuck the motorman can go
to the back end and run it just as well as at the
front end,” said the smallest Corner House girl,
promptly.
</p>
<p>
“Some kid that!” murmured Neale, while the
others laughed. “Have you tried the whip,
ma’am?” he asked of the woman in the basket
phaeton.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve broken it on him,” confessed the woman,
shaking her head. “He doesn’t even feel it. The
flies bother him more than a whip. He is just the
most tantalizing brute of a horse that ever was.
Jonas! Get up!”
</p>
<p>
Jonas stood still. He merely flicked flies and
wagged his ears. He was really the most peaceful
animate object visible in the whole landscape.
</p>
<p>
The Corner House girls, since coming to Milton
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
to live in the old dwelling that Uncle Peter Stower
had left them at his death, had enjoyed many adventures,
but few more ridiculous than this.
Here they sat in their new, high-powered car,
ready and anxious to spin over the country roads
to their goal—a famous picnicking grounds fifty
miles from Milton—and a little old fat brown
pony, with a stubborn disposition and a cropped
mane, held them up as certainly as though he had
been a highway robber!
</p>
<p>
The four young Kenways—Ruth, Agnes, Tess
and Dot—with Aunt Sarah Maltby (who really
was only an “adopted” aunt) had been very poor
indeed before Uncle Peter Stower had died and
left the girls the bulk of his estate and a small
legacy to Aunt Sarah.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge, the administrator of the estate
and the girls’ guardian, had come to the Kenways’
poor tenement in the city where they lived,
and had taken them to the old Corner House—quite
an old mansion overlooking the Parade
Ground in Milton, and supposed by some of the
neighbors to be “haunted.”
</p>
<p>
How the girls laid the “garret ghost” and how
they proved their right and title to Uncle Peter’s
estate against the claims of a certain Mrs. Treble
(known as “Mrs. Trouble” to the rather pert
Agnes) and her little girl, “Double-Trouble,” is
told in the first volume of this series, entitled “The
Corner House Girls.”
</p>
<p>
Afterward the little “Adamless Eden” on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
corner of Willow and Main Streets is trespassed
upon by a boy who has run away from a circus to
get an education—Neale O’Neil. He proves to be
a thoroughly likable boy, and even Ruth and Tess,
who do not much approve of the opposite sex, are
prone to like Neale.
</p>
<p>
In “The Corner House Girls at School” Neale
becomes a fixture in the neighborhood, living with
Mr. Con Murphy, the little old cobbler on the street
back of the Stower place, and doing chores for the
Corner House girls and other neighbors to help
support himself while he attends school.
</p>
<p>
The girls extend their acquaintance widely during
this first school year at Milton, and when summer
comes they visit Pleasant Cove, where they
befriend Rosa and June Wildwood, two Southern
girls, and meanwhile have adventures galore along
the shore. Indeed, “The Corner House Girls Under
Canvas” introduces many new friends to both
the girls themselves and to the reader, notable
among whom is Tom Jonah, who, although only a
dog, is a thorough gentleman.
</p>
<p>
The girls’ friendliness to all living creatures
gathers about them, as is natural, a galaxy of pets,
including a rapidly growing menagerie of cats,
the dog in question, a goat, and (this is Agnes’
inclusion) Sammy Pinkney, the little boy who is
determined to be a pirate when he grows up.
</p>
<p>
The fall following this summer vacation just
mentioned, sees all the Corner House girls taking
part in a play produced by the combined effort
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
of the town schools. Their failures and successes
in producing <em>The Carnation Countess</em> is interwoven
with a mystery surrounding the punishment
of Agnes and some of her fellow-classmates
for an infraction of the rules—a punishment that
promises at one time to spoil the play entirely.
“The Corner House Girls in a Play” is interesting
and it turns out happily in the end. One of the
best things about it is the fact that three thousand
dollars is raised by means of the play for the
Women’s and Children’s Hospital, and Mrs.
Eland, the matron, is able to retain her position in
that institution.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Eland and her sister, Miss Pepperill, who
has been Tess Kenway’s school teacher, become
very good friends of the Corner House girls. In
the volume of the series immediately preceding
this present narrative, entitled “The Corner
House Girls’ Odd Find” the Kenways find an old,
apparently worthless, album in the garret of the
mansion—a treasure room which seems inexhaustible
in its supply of mystery and amusing incidents.
</p>
<p>
This album seems to contain a lot of counterfeit
money and bonds, which in the end prove
to have been hidden in the Stower house by a
miserly uncle of Mrs. Eland and Miss Pepperill,
Mr. Lemuel Aden, who had died too suddenly
to make a will or to tell of his hidden treasure—and
the money and bonds are really perfectly
good.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
The four Kenway sisters, therefore, saw their
friends, the hospital matron and the school
teacher, made comfortably wealthy for life; and
the beautiful, seven passenger touring car, with
self-starter, “quick top,” and all the modern appurtenances
of a good automobile, was the gift of
the legatees of Mr. Lemuel Aden.
</p>
<p>
“But it might as well be a flivver,” said Agnes, in
disgust, “if we’ve got to sit here all day and watch
a fat brown pony whisk his tail.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see what I can do, my dear,” said the
woman in the basket phaeton. “You can’t lead
him, and you can’t push him, and I verily believe if
you built a fire under him he’d just move up far
enough to burn the cart, and stand there until his
harness scorched him.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes giggled at that, and was her own jolly
self again. “It’s up to you, Neale O’Neil,” she
declared. “You’re the chauffeur and are supposed
to make us go. Make us!”
</p>
<p>
“Get out and walk around the pony,” proposed
Neale, grinning.
</p>
<p>
“And what about the car?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think we could lift it over?” said Ruth,
with scorn.
</p>
<p>
“Now, young man,” Agnes pursued, with gravity.
“It is your duty to get us to Marchenell
Grove. We’re still twenty-five or thirty miles
away from it——”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” exclaimed the lady in front.
“Were you young folks going there?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
</p>
<p>
“We had an idea of doing so when we started,
ma’am,” said Agnes, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“I should have gone there to-day, too——”
</p>
<p>
“Not with that pony?” shrieked Agnes, clasping
her hands.
</p>
<p>
“Why—no,” said the lady, smiling. “But if
my nephew hadn’t lost his automobile he would
have taken me. Oh, dear! Now I shall have to
ride behind Jonas all the time.”
</p>
<p>
“You really don’t call this riding, do you,
ma’am?” asked the irrepressible Agnes.
</p>
<p>
The woman laughed. She liked Agnes Kenway
from the first, as almost everybody who met
her did.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not riding fast just now, and that’s a
fact,” she said, nodding her bonnet with its many
bows. “Nor does Jonas take me over the roads
very rapidly at his very best pace.”
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil had got slowly out of the car and
now walked around to the head of the fat brown
pony. The pony had blue eyes, and they were
very mild. But he seemed to have no idea of
going on and getting himself and his mistress out
of the way of the automobile. Maybe he did not
like automobiles.
</p>
<p>
“You see, my nephew bought a car and we let
Jonas kick up his heels in the paddock. Oh! he’s
lively enough when he wants to be—Jonas, I mean.
But my nephew’s car was stolen day before yesterday—and
he’s worried almost to death about it,
poor man.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Ruth, “who <em>is</em> your nephew,
Madam?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Philip Collinger is my nephew. He’s the
county surveyor, you know. A very bright young
man—if I do say it. But not bright enough to
keep from having his auto stolen,” she added, ruefully.
</p>
<p>
Just then Agnes, who had been watching Neale
O’Neil, called:
</p>
<p>
“What <em>are</em> you doing to that pony, Neale?”
</p>
<p>
The boy had rubbed the fat brown pony’s nose.
He had lifted first one foot and then the other, going
all around the pony to do so. He had patted
his neck. Jonas had seemed rather to like these
attentions. He still whisked flies calmly.
</p>
<p>
Now Neale reached over and took one of the
pony’s ears in his hand, holding it firmly. To the
other ear the boy put his lips and seemed to be
whispering something privately to Jonas.
</p>
<p>
“What <em>are</em> you doing to that pony, Neale?”
cried Agnes again.
</p>
<p>
“Mercy! what is the boy doing? Why, Jonas
doesn’t pay any attention to me when I fairly yell
at him. He’s deaf, I believe.”
</p>
<p>
And then the lady stopped, startled. The four
Corner House girls all expressed their amazement
with a united cry. Neale had taken the pony
firmly by the bridle and was leading him quietly
out of the middle of the road.
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake!” gasped the pony’s mistress,
“I never saw the like of that before.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
</p>
<p>
Jonas seemed to have forgotten all about balking.
He still wagged his ears to keep the flies
away and whisked his tail industriously.
</p>
<p>
Neale, leading the pony, turned a corner in the
lane, and there came upon a house. The lady had
left the phaeton to speak to the girls more companionably.
Neale tied the pony to the picket
fence before the house, leaving the hitching strap
long enough to allow the animal to graze.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I want to know!” cried the woman, when
the boy returned to the car. “How did you do
that? What did you do to Jonas to make him
change his mind?”
</p>
<p>
“This is Mrs. Heard, Neale,” said Ruth, smiling.
“You sometimes <em>do</em> prove to be a smart boy.
What did you do to him?”
</p>
<p>
Neale grinned broadly. He had been used to
horses all his life and he knew a few tricks of the
Gypsies and the horse-traders.
</p>
<p>
“I just told him something,” the boy said.
</p>
<p>
“Oo-ee!” cried Tess. “Did you really whisper
to him?”
</p>
<p>
Neale nodded.
</p>
<p>
“<em>What</em> did you whisper to the pony?” asked
Dot, wide-eyed.
</p>
<p>
Agnes snapped, thinking Neale was fooling her:
“I don’t believe it!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I whispered to him,” said the boy, seriously.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” remonstrated Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Well! For all I ever heard!” exclaimed Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
Heard. “What did you whisper to that vexatious
brute of a pony?”
</p>
<p>
“If I told what it was, that would spoil the
charm,” said Neale, gravely.
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!” ejaculated Agnes, flushing.
</p>
<p>
“Now you know that is ridiculous,” said Ruth,
inclined to be exasperated with the boy as much as
she had been with the pony.
</p>
<p>
“No. It is a fact,” said the boy, decidedly.
</p>
<p>
“Now, you know that isn’t so, Neale O’Neil!”
cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I assure you it is. Anyway, they say if you
tell it—what you say—to anybody else, the horse
will balk again right away. It’s a secret between
him and the person——”
</p>
<p>
“I never heard such a ridiculous thing in all my
life,” gasped Mrs. Heard.
</p>
<p>
“I think you are not very polite, Neale,” said
Ruth, quite sternly.
</p>
<p>
“Now see here!” cried the badgered boy, getting
rather vexed himself. “I tell you I can’t
tell you——”
</p>
<p>
“You’re talking anything but English,” complained
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Well, maybe I didn’t talk English into the
pony’s ear,” retorted Neale, grinning suddenly
again. “Anyway, the old Gyp who taught me that
trick told me I must never say the words aloud, or
to anybody who would not make proper use of the
magic formula.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, shucks!” exclaimed Agnes, in disgust.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
“Tell me. I’ll try it on Billy Bumps when <em>he</em>
balks,” said Tess, in a small voice.
</p>
<p>
At that they all laughed and Neale got in behind
the steering wheel again. The two older girls
were much interested in Mrs. Heard and that
woman was evidently pleased with the sisters.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes; I ought to know you Corner House
girls. Goodness knows I’ve heard enough about
you—and my name being Heard, I heard a lot!”
and she laughed. “But you see, I live away on
this side of town, and don’t go to your church; so
we have never met before.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure the loss has been ours,” said Ruth,
politely. “I hope your pony will not balk again
to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness knows! He’ll balk if he takes a notion
to. I don’t suppose what you whispered to
him is guaranteed to be a permanent cure, is it,
boy?” she asked Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am,” grinned the boy.
</p>
<p>
“And you expected to go to Marchenell Grove
to-day, Mrs. Heard?” Ruth said, reflectively, looking
at Agnes enquiringly although she spoke to the
mistress of the fat brown pony.
</p>
<p>
“I had thought to. Philly Collinger was going
to take me. But if he doesn’t recover his car he’ll
not take me auto riding very soon again.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Ruth, having received a nod of
acquiescence from Agnes, “I don’t see why you
shouldn’t go there to-day just the same. Won’t
you come with us? There’s room in the car.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
“Goody! Of course she can!” cried Agnes,
clapping her hands.
</p>
<p>
“I think that would be real nice,” agreed Tess.
</p>
<p>
Dot moved over at once to make room. “She
can sit beside me and the Alice-doll,” she proclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I declare!” exclaimed Mrs. Heard, her
face alight with pleasure at this united invitation.
“You are just the nicest girls I ever met. I wonder
if I’d better?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Ruth. “You can find some
place to leave the pony. Or Neale can, I’m sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I know these people right in the very
next house,” said Mrs. Heard. “Indeed I expected
to call there if Jonas ever got that far.”
</p>
<p>
Neale got briskly out of the car again. “I’ll
go and unharness him,” he said, cheerfully.
“You just find out where I shall put him. He’d
rather have you ride in an automobile than drag
you himself,” and he laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Did—did he <em>tell</em> you so, Neale, when you were
talking with him?” asked Dot, in amazement.
</p>
<p>
Then they all laughed.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—WHAT MRS. HEARD TOLD</h2>
<p>
In ten minutes the Kenway car was moving
again. Jonas had been put up at the barn of Mrs.
Heard’s friends, near which the pony had balked,
and Neale soon whisked them out of sight of the
place.
</p>
<p>
“This—this is just delightful,” sighed Mrs.
Heard. “Especially after sitting behind that
brute of a pony. I <em>do</em> love an automobile.”
</p>
<p>
“So do I!” Agnes cried. “I’d rather ride in
this car than in a golden chariot—I know I would.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know how they run chariots, nowadays,”
said Neale, chuckling; “whether by horse-power
or gas. But sometimes a car balks, you
know.”
</p>
<p>
“Not so often as that Jonas,” declared Mrs.
Heard. “I’ve been out with my nephew a lot.
His is a nice car. I hope he’ll find it.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course the thieves will be apprehended,”
said Ruth. “What good are the
police?”
</p>
<p>
“When it comes to autos,” said Neale, slyly,
“the police are mostly good for stopping you and
getting you fined.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, don’t <em>you</em> dare drive too fast and get us
fined, Neale O’Neil,” ordered Ruth, sternly.
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am,” he returned. But Agnes whispered
in his ear:
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care how fast you run it, Neale. I
love to go fast.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll be a speed fiend, Aggie,” he declared.
“That’s what you’ll be.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I want to drive. I must learn.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to ask Mr. Howbridge about that,”
Neale told her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am! He told me that I shouldn’t allow
anybody to run the car but a properly qualified
person.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean it?” gasped the eager girl.
</p>
<p>
“That’s right! A person with a license.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t believe it, Neale O’Neil!” wailed
Agnes. “How am I ever going to learn, then?”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to go to the garage as I did and
take lessons.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes pouted over this. Mrs. Heard, meanwhile,
was saying to Ruth:
</p>
<p>
“Yes, the stealing of my nephew’s auto was an
outrage. Politics in this county are most disgraceful.
If we women voted——”
</p>
<p>
“But, Mrs. Heard! what have politics to do with
your nephew’s auto being stolen?” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! it wasn’t any ordinary thief, or perhaps
thieves, who took his car. He is sure of that.
You see, there are some politicians who want the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
plans and maps of the new road surveys his office
has been making.”
</p>
<p>
“What sort of maps are those?” asked Tess,
who was listening. “Like those we have to outline
in the geography?”
</p>
<p>
“They are not like those, chicken,” laughed
Ruth. “They are outlines—drawings. They
show the road levels and grades. I guess you
don’t understand. Don’t you remember those
men who came the other day and looked through
instruments on our sidewalk and measured with a
long tape line, and all that?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” confessed Tess. “I saw them.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, they were surveyors. And they were
working for Mr. Collinger, I suppose,” said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
“I saw them, too,” proclaimed Dot. “I thought
they were photo—photographers. I went out
there and stood with my Alice-doll right in front of
one of those things on the three sticks.”
</p>
<p>
“You did?” cried Agnes, who heard this.
“What for, Dottums?”
</p>
<p>
“To get our picture tooken,” said Dot, gravely.
“And then I asked the man when it would be done
and if we could see a picture.”
</p>
<p>
“Ho, ho!” laughed Neale O’Neil. “What did
he say?”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” confessed the smallest Corner House
girl, indignantly, “he said I’d be grown up—and
so would Alice—before that picture was enveloped——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Developed’!” cried Tess.
</p>
<p>
“No. Enveloped,” said Dot, stoutly. “You
always get photograph proofs in an envelope.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Mrs. Heard were laughing heartily.
Agnes said, admiringly:
</p>
<p>
“You’re a wonder, Dot! If there is a possible
way of fumbling a thing, you do it.”
</p>
<p>
The little girls were not likely to understand all
that Mrs. Heard said about the disappearance of
Mr. Collinger’s automobile—no more than Dot understood
about the surveyor’s transit. But they
listened.
</p>
<p>
“You understand, Miss Ruth,” said the aunt of
the county surveyor, “that Phil Collinger is responsible
for all those tracings and maps that are
being made in this road survey.
</p>
<p>
“If it gets out just what changes are to be made
in grades and routes through the county before the
commission renders its report, there is a chance
for some of these ‘pauper politicians,’ as Philly
calls them, to make money.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see how,” said Agnes, putting her oar
in. “What good would the maps do even dishonest
people?”
</p>
<p>
“Because with foreknowledge of the highway
commission’s determinations, men could go and
get options upon property adjoining the highways
that will be changed, and either sell to the
county at a big profit or hold abutting properties
for the natural rise in land values that will follow.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
“I understand what an option is,” said Ruth.
“It is a small sum which a man pays down on a
place, with the privilege of buying it at a stated
price within a given length of time.”
</p>
<p>
“You talk just like a judge, Ruthie,” giggled
Agnes. “For my part I don’t understand it at all.
But I’m sorry Mr. Collinger lost his car.”
</p>
<p>
“And it was stolen so boldly,” said Neale, shaking
his head.
</p>
<p>
“But why did they steal the car, Mrs. Heard?”
demanded Ruth, sticking to the main theme.
“What has that to do with the surveyors’ maps?”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” said the lady, slowly, “they must have
seen Philly come out of the court house and throw
a package into the car. He covered it with a robe.
They knew—or supposed they knew—that he carried
the maps around with him. He could not
even trust the safe in his office. It’s no better than
a tin can and could be opened with a hammer and
chisel.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” exclaimed Agnes, interested again.
“So they stole the car to get the maps? Just like
a moving picture play, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it is,” sighed the lady. “But it is quite
serious for Philly—whether they got the maps or
not.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! <em>Didn’t</em> they?” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“That—that he won’t say,” said Mrs. Heard,
shaking her head. “I’m sure <em>I</em> don’t know.
Philly Collinger can be just as close-mouthed as an
oyster—and so I tell him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
“But everybody thinks the maps were in that
package he put in the car before he ran across the
street to get a bite of lunch. And I’m pretty sure
that he isn’t worried all <em>that</em> much over the stealing
of his car. Though goodness knows when he
can ever afford to buy another. The salary of surveyor
in this county isn’t a fortune.
</p>
<p>
“So, there it is,” said Mrs. Heard. “The car’s
gone, and I guess the maps and data are gone with
it. Somebody, of course, hired the two scamps
that took it to do the trick——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, were there two?” asked Neale, who had
been running the car slowly again in order to
listen.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. They were seen; but nobody supposed
they were stealing the car, of course.”
</p>
<p>
“What kind of men were they? How did they
look?” asked Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want to know for, Miss Detective?”
chuckled Neale.
</p>
<p>
“So as to be on the watch for them. If I see
one of them about our car, I shall make a disturbance,”
announced the beauty, with decision.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know much about them,” admitted Mrs.
Heard, laughing with the others over Agnes’ statement.
“But one was a young man with a fancy
band on his straw hat and yellow freckles on his
face. I believe he had a little mustache. But he
might shave that,” she added, reflectively.
</p>
<p>
“And change the band on his hat,” whispered
Neale to Agnes, his eyes dancing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
</p>
<p>
“Never mind about his hat-band, Neale
O’Neil!” cried Agnes, standing up suddenly in a
most disconcerting way. “What <em>is</em> that ahead?”
</p>
<p>
Neale promptly shut off the power and braked.
Agnes was greatly excited, and she pointed to a
place in the road not many yards in advance.
</p>
<p>
The way was narrow, with rocky fields on either
side approached by rather steep banks. Indeed,
the road lay through what might well be called a
ravine. It was the worst piece of road, too (so
the guidebook, said), of any stretch between Milton
and Marchenell Grove.
</p>
<p>
As the car stopped, Neale saw what Agnes had
seen. Right across the way—directly in front
of the automobile—lay something long and iridescent.
It was moving.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” shrieked Agnes again. “It’s a snake—a
horrid, great, big snake!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what under the sun did you make me stop
for?” demanded the boy. “I’d have gone right
over it.”
</p>
<p>
“That would have been cruel, boy,” declared
Mrs. Heard, from behind.
</p>
<p>
“Cruel? Huh! It’s a rattler,” returned
Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! It’s never!” gasped Agnes, not
meaning to be impolite.
</p>
<p>
“A rattler, Neale?” asked Ruth. “Are you
sure?”
</p>
<p>
“What’s a rattler?” asked Dot, composedly.
“Is it what they make baby’s rattles out of?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mercy, no!” shivered Tess. “Neale means
it’s a rattlesnake.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I don’t like <em>them</em>,” declared Dot, immediately
picking up the Alice-doll, of which she always
first thought in time of peril.
</p>
<p>
“What shall we do?” demanded Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t he drive around it?” asked Mrs. Heard,
rather excitedly. “I don’t believe at all in hurting
<em>any</em> dumb animal—not even a snake or a spider.”
</p>
<p>
“How about breaking the whip on old Jonas?”
whispered Neale to Agnes.
</p>
<p>
But his girl friend was all of a shiver. “<em>Do</em>
get around it, Neale,” she begged.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t. The road’s too narrow,” declared the
boy, with promptness. “And I am bound to run
over the thing if it doesn’t move out of the way.
I can’t help it.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait!” cried Mrs. Heard. “Get out and poke
it with a stick.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mrs. Heard!” exclaimed Ruth, “do you
realize that a rattlesnake is deadly poison? I
wouldn’t let Neale do such a thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Besides being a suffragist,” declared Mrs.
Heard, firmly, “I am a professing and acting
member of the S.P.C.A. I cannot look on and
see a harmless beast—it is not doing anything to
us—wantonly killed or injured.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-<em>night</em>!” murmured Neale.
</p>
<p>
Just then the snake—and it was a big fellow, all
of six feet long—seemed to awaken. Perhaps it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
had been chilled by the coolness of the night before;
it was lethargic, at any rate.
</p>
<p>
It lifted its head, whirled into the very middle
of the road, and faced the automobile defiantly.
In a moment it had coiled and sprung its rattle.
The whirring sound, once heard, is never to be
mistaken for any other.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! what shall we do?” gasped Agnes.
“If you try to run over it, it may get into the
car—or something,” said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
The roadway was narrower here than it had
been back where the brown pony had held the
party up. This first trip in their automobile
seemed to be fraught with much adventure for the
Corner House girls and Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—SALERATUS JOE</h2>
<p>
Neale O’Neil knew very well that he could not
satisfy everybody—least of all the rattlesnake.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard did not want her S.P.C.A. sensibilities
hurt; Agnes wanted him to drive on; Ruth
wished him to dodge the coiled rattler. As for
getting out and “coaxing it to move on” with a
stick, Neale had no such intention.
</p>
<p>
He tried starting slowly to see if the serpent
would be frightened and open the way for the passage
of the car. But the rattler instantly coiled
and sprang twice at the hood. The second time
it sank its fangs into the left front tire.
</p>
<p>
“Cricky!” gasped Neale. “They say you swell
all up when one of those things injects poison into
you; but I don’t believe that tire will swell any
more than it is.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t make fun!” groaned Agnes. “Suppose
it should jump into the car?”
</p>
<p>
“If we only had a gun,” began Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I hope you haven’t, young man,” cried
Mrs. Heard. “I’m deadly afraid of firearms.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t get out of the car, Neale,” begged
Agnes, clasping her hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
“Try to back away from it,” suggested Ruth.
</p>
<p>
The smaller girls clung to each other (Dot determinedly
to the Alice-doll, as well), and, although
they did not say much, they were frightened.
Tess whispered:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! I’m ‘fraid enough of the wriggling
fish-worms that Sammy digs in our garden.
And this snake is a hundred times as big!”
</p>
<p>
“And fish-worms don’t shoot people with their
tongues, do they?” suggested Dot.
</p>
<p>
Just at that very moment, when the six-foot rattler
had coiled to strike again, there was a rattling
and jangling of tinware from up the road.
There was a turn not far ahead, and the young
folks could not see beyond it.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” exploded Agnes, “what’s coming
now?”
</p>
<p>
“Not another rattlesnake, I bet a cent—though
it’s some rattling,” chuckled Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
The heads of a pair of horses then appeared
around the turn. They proved to be drawing a
tin-peddler’s wagon, and over this rough piece of
driveway the wash-boilers, dishpans, kettles,
pails, and a dozen other articles of tin and agate-ware,
were making more noise than the passage
of a battery of artillery.
</p>
<p>
Some scientists have pointed out that snakes—some
snakes, at least—seem to be hard of hearing.
That could not have been so with the big
rattlesnake that had held up the Kenways and
their automobile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
Before the Jewish peddler on the seat of the
wagon could draw his willing horses to a halt,
the snake swiftly uncoiled and wriggled across
the road and into the bushes. All that was left
to mark his recent presence was a wavy mark in
the dust.
</p>
<p>
“Vat’s the madder?” called the peddler.
“Ain’t dere room to ged by?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” said the relieved Neale. “Let me
back a little and you pull out to the right, and
we’ll be all right. We were held up by a snake.”
</p>
<p>
The Jew (he was a little man with fiery hair
and whiskers, and he had a narrow-brimmed derby
hat jammed down upon his head), seemed to study
over this answer of the boy for fully a minute.
Then, as Neale was steering the automobile
slowly past his rig, he leaned sidewise and asked,
with a broad smile:
</p>
<p>
“I say, mister! Vat did you say stopped
you?”
</p>
<p>
“A snake,” declared Neale, grinning.
</p>
<p>
“Oy, oy! And that it iss yedt to drive one of
them so benzine carts? No! Mein horses iss petter.
They are not afraid of snakes.”
</p>
<p>
He still sat, without starting his team, thinking
the surprising matter over, when the automobile
turned the curve in the road and struck better
going.
</p>
<p>
“Well!” ejaculated Agnes, “I only hope he
stays there till that snake comes out of the bushes
again and climbs into his cart.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
“My! how disagreeable you can be,” returned
Neale, laughing. “I don’t believe you’ll get your
wish, however.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad we didn’t run over that snake,” declared
Mrs. Heard, nodding her head. “I’m opposed
to killing any dumb creature.”
</p>
<p>
“Then,” suggested Dot, earnestly, “you must
be like Mr. Seneca Sprague.”
</p>
<p>
“Me? Like Seneca Sprague?” gasped the
lady, yet rather amused. “I like that!”
</p>
<p>
“Why, how can that be, Dot?” asked Ruth,
rather puzzled herself, for Seneca Sprague was a
queer character who was thought by most Milton
people to be a little crazy.
</p>
<p>
“Why, he’s a vegetablearian. And Mrs. Heard
must be,” announced Dot, confidently, “if she
doesn’t believe in killing dumb beasts.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s logic for you!” exclaimed Neale.
“Score one for Dot.”
</p>
<p>
The lady laughed heartily. “I suppose I ought
to be a ‘vegetablearian’ if I’m not,” she said. “I
dunno as I could worship beasts the way some of
the ancients did; but I don’t believe in killing
them unnecessarily.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>I</em> know about some of the animal gods and goddesses
the Greeks and Egyptians used to worship,”
ventured Tess, who had not taken much
part in the conversation of late. “Did any of
them worship snakes, do you s’pose?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe some peoples did,” Ruth told her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, <em>I</em> know about gods and goddesses,” cried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
Dot, eagerly. “Our teacher read about them—or,
<em>some</em> of them—only yesterday, in school.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Miss Know-it-all,” said Agnes, good-naturedly,
“what did you learn about them?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I remember ‘bout one named Ceres,” said
the smallest Corner House girl, with corrugated
brow, trying to remember what she had heard
read.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what about her?” asked Agnes, encouragingly.
</p>
<p>
“What was Ceres the goddess of, honey?” pursued
Ruth, as Dot still hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why she was the goddess of dressmaking,”
declared the child, with sudden conviction.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh, oh!” ejaculated Neale, under his
breath.
</p>
<p>
“For goodness sake! where did you get <em>that</em>
idea?” demanded Ruth, while Agnes and Mrs.
Heard positively could not keep from laughing,
and Tess looked at her smaller sister with something
like horror. “Why—Dot Kenway!” she
murmured.
</p>
<p>
“She is, too!” pouted Dot. “My teacher said
so. She said Ceres was the goddess of ‘ripping
and sewing.’ Now, isn’t that dressmaking?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, cricky!” gasped Neale, and swerved the
car to the left in his emotion.
</p>
<p>
“Do be careful, Neale!” squealed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. You’ll have us into something,” warned
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Then put ear-muffs on me,” groaned the boy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
“That child will be the death of me yet. ‘Sowing
and reaping’—‘ripping and sewing’—wow!”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” observed Agnes. “You needn’t be
the death of <em>us</em> if she does say something funny.
<em>Do</em> keep your mind on what you are about,
Neale.”
</p>
<p>
But Neale O’Neil was a careful driver. He was
a sober boy, anyway, and would never qualify in
the joy-riding class, that was sure.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of the ride to Marchenell Grove
was a jolly and enjoyable one. They all liked
Mrs. Heard more and more as they became better
acquainted with her. She seemed to know just
how to get along with young folk, and despite her
stated suffragist and S.P.C.A. proclivities, even
Neale pronounced her “good fun.”
</p>
<p>
The Grove was a very popular resort, and very
large. Perhaps it was just as well that Mrs.
Heard was with the girls, for unexpectedly a situation
developed during the day that might have
been really unpleasant had not an older person—like
the good and talkative lady—been with
them.
</p>
<p>
There was a large party of picnickers that had
come together and that made one end of the
grounds very lively. There was an orchestra with
them and they usurped the dancing pavilion. Not
that Ruth or Agnes would have danced here;
neither Mr. Howbridge nor Mrs. MacCall would
have approved; nor did Mrs. Heard countenance
dancing in such a public place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
But after they had all been out in boats on the
river, and had eaten their lunch, and enjoyed the
swings, and strolled through the pleasant paths
of the Grove, it was only natural that the two
older Kenways should wish to see the dancing.
They had no idea that the crowd about the pavilion
was rowdyish.
</p>
<p>
Neale was busy with the car in preparation for
their return to Milton. The little girls were
watching him at work, and Mrs. Heard was resting
in the car, too. So Ruth and Agnes went
alone down to the pavilion.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me,” sighed Agnes. “I really wish we
<em>could</em> have just one spin on the floor—just us two.
That music makes my feet fairly <em>itch</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“You will have to possess your soul with patience—or
else scratch your poor little feet,”
laughed her sister. “To think of your wanting
to dance <em>here</em>! I am afraid all these people—especially
the boys—are not nice.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care. I don’t want to dance with
<em>them</em>,” pouted Agnes. “Only with you. I just
love to dance to this piece the orchestra is playing.”
</p>
<p>
“Save it till next week’s school dance,” laughed
Ruth. “Oh!”
</p>
<p>
Her startled ejaculation was brought out by
the appearance of a strange young man at her elbow.
He was really not a nice looking fellow at
all, his face was unpleasantly freckled, and the
corners of his lips and the ends of the first three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
fingers of his right hand were stained deeply by
the use of cigarettes.
</p>
<p>
“Aft’noon!” said this stranger, affably.
“Want a whirl? The floor’s fine—come on in.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes, who was much more timid in reality
than she usually appeared, shrank from the fellow,
trying to draw Ruth with her.
</p>
<p>
“Let the kid wait for us,” suggested the
freckled young man, leering good-naturedly
enough at Agnes, and probably not at all aware
that he was distasteful to the Kenway girls. “We
can have one whirl.”
</p>
<p>
“I am much obliged to you,” Ruth said, rather
falteringly. “I would rather not.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, say—just a turn. Don’t throw me down,”
said the fellow, his eyes becoming suddenly hard
and the smile beginning to disappear from his
face.
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you. Neither my sister nor I wish
to dance here,” said Ruth, growing bolder—and
more indignant.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t tell me you don’t know how to dance?”
growled the freckled one.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t tell you anything, but that we do not
wish to dance,” and Ruth tried to turn away from
him.
</p>
<p>
The fellow stepped directly in their path. They
were just on the fringe of loiterers about the pavilion.
Agnes clapped a hand upon her lips to
keep from screaming.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
</p>
<p>
“Aw, come on,” said the fellow, laying a detaining
hand upon Ruth’s arm.
</p>
<p>
Then something very unexpected, but very welcome,
happened. Mrs. Heard, seeing a hand’s
breadth of cloud in the sky and fearing a thunder
storm, had sent Neale O’Neil scurrying for the
girls. He came to the spot before this affair could
go any farther.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo!” he exclaimed, sharply. “What’s
this?”
</p>
<p>
“This—this gentleman,” said Ruth, faintly,
“offers to dance with me, but I tell him ‘no.’”
</p>
<p>
“What are <em>you</em> butting in for, kid?” demanded
the freckled young fellow, thrusting his jaw forward
in an ugly manner. But he took his hand
from Ruth’s arm.
</p>
<p>
Neale said to the girls, quite quietly though his
eyes flashed:
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Heard wants you to come back to the car
at once. Please hurry.”
</p>
<p>
“Say! I don’t get you,” began the rough
again.
</p>
<p>
“You will in a moment,” Neale shot at him.
“Go away, girls!”
</p>
<p>
Agnes did not want to go now; but Ruth saw
it would be better and she fairly dragged her sister
away.
</p>
<p>
“Neale will be hurt!” moaned Agnes, all the
way to the car. “That awful rowdy has friends,
of course.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
</p>
<p>
What really happened to Neale the girls never
knew, for he would not talk about it. Trained
from his very babyhood as an acrobat, the ex-circus
boy would be able to give a good account of
himself if it came to fisticuffs with the freckled-faced
fellow. Although the latter was considerably
older and taller than Neale, the way he had
lived had not hardened his muscles and made him
quick of eye and foot or handy with his fists.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Neale did not fight at all. At least he
came back to the car without a mark upon him and
without even having had his clothes ruffled. All
he said in answer to the excited questions of the
girls was:
</p>
<p>
“That’s a fellow called Saleratus Joe. You can
tell why—his face with all those yellow freckles
looks like an old fashioned saleratus biscuit. He
belongs in Milton. I’ve seen him before. He
isn’t much better than a saloon lounger.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” exclaimed Mrs. Heard.
“Saleratus Joe is one of the fellows who my
nephew thinks stole his automobile. I must tell
him that we saw the fellow. Perhaps the car can
be traced after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Through Saleratus Joe?” said Neale O’Neil.
“Well—maybe.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—DOT’S AWFUL ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>
Altogether that first run in their automobile
was pronounced a jolly success by the Corner
House girls. The return journey from Marchenell
Grove was without incident.
</p>
<p>
“If we had only become acquainted with Mrs.
Heard the trip would have been more than worth
while,” declared Ruth, who was seldom as enthusiastic
about a new acquaintance as she was about
the aunt of the county surveyor. “She is coming
to see us soon.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes was more interested in another thing, and
she confided in Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Do you really suppose, Neale,” she asked,
“that the awful fellow who spoke to Ruth is one
of those who stole Mr. Collinger’s auto?”
</p>
<p>
“Saleratus Joe?” chuckled the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Hasn’t he any other name? It sounds like—like
the Wild West in the movies, or something
like that.”
</p>
<p>
“They only call him that for fun,” explained
Neale O’Neil. “And whether he helped get away
with the surveyor’s machine or not, I’m sure I
don’t know.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
</p>
<p>
“But can’t you <em>guess</em>?” cried Agnes, in exasperation.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the use of guessing?” returned her
boy chum. “That won’t get you anywhere.
You’re a poor detective, Aggie.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t make fun,” complained Agnes, who was
very much excited about the automobile robbery.
They had just got their car, and she had longed
for it so deeply that she was beginning to be worried
for fear something would happen to it.
</p>
<p>
“Shut Tom Jonah into the garage at night,”
Neale suggested. “I warrant no thieves will
take it.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge, while he was about it, had had
a cement block garage built on the rear of the
Stower premises facing Willow Street, for the
housing of the Corner House girls’ motor car.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Collinger’s auto was stolen right on the
street,” said Agnes, doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the worst of these flivvers,” retorted
Neale, with a grin. “People are apt to come along
and pick ’em up absent-mindedly and go off with
them. Say! have you heard the latest?”
</p>
<p>
“What about?” asked Agnes, dreamily.
</p>
<p>
“About the flivver. Do you know what the
chickens say when one of ’em goes by?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” declared the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Cheep! Cheep! Cheep!” mimicked the boy.
</p>
<p>
Agnes giggled. Then she said: “But Mr. Collinger’s
wasn’t one of those cheap cars. It <em>was</em>
a runabout; but it cost him a lot of money.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
</p>
<p>
“But that freckled-faced young man, Neale—<em>do</em>
you suppose he could be the one Mrs. Heard said
was seen driving the stolen car away from the
court house?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, how should <em>I</em> know?” demanded Neale.
“I’m no seventh son of a seventh son.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish we had seen a constable out there in
the grove and had had him arrested.”
</p>
<p>
“What for? On what charge?” cried Neale,
wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, because he spoke to Ruth and me. Then
he could be held while his record was looked up.
Maybe Mr. Collinger could have recovered his car
by that means.”
</p>
<p>
“Cricky!” ejaculated the boy. “You’ve been
reading the police court reports in the newspapers,
I believe, Aggie.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! that’s what they do,” declared the girl,
confidently.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe so. But you couldn’t have had the fellow
arrested for speaking to you. You shouldn’t
have been around the dance floor if you wanted to
escape that. But, perhaps that freckled rascal <em>is</em>
one of the thieves, and maybe he can be traced.
Mrs. Heard will tell her nephew and he will attend
to it—no fear!”
</p>
<p>
“But it would be just great, Neale, if we could
do something toward recovering the car and getting
the thieves arrested,” said Agnes who, as
Neale often said, if she went into a thing, went into
it all over!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
They had not much time just then, however, to
give to the mystery of the county surveyor’s lost
automobile. Final examinations were coming on
and the closing of school would be the next week
but one.
</p>
<p>
Even Dot was busy with school work, although
she was not very far advanced in her studies; and
during these last few days she was released from
her classes in the afternoon earlier than the other
Corner House girls.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes she walked toward Meadow Street,
which was across town from the Corner House and
in a poorer section of Milton, with some of her
little school friends before coming home; and so
she almost always met Sammy Pinkney loafing
along Willow Street on returning.
</p>
<p>
Sammy did not go to school this term. Scarlet
fever had left this would-be pirate so weak and
pale that the physician had advised nothing but
out-of-doors for him until autumn.
</p>
<p>
Sammy, in some ways, was a changed boy since
his serious illness. He was much thinner and less
robust looking, of course; but the changes in him
were not all of a physical nature. For one thing,
he was not so rough with his near-neighbors, the
Corner House girls. They had been very kind to
him while he was ill, and his mother was always
singing their praises. Besides, the other boys being
in school, Sammy was lonely and was only too
glad as a usual thing to have even Dot to talk to
or play with.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
Dot was a little afraid of Sammy, even now, because
of his past well-won reputation. And, too,
his reiterated desire to be a pirate cast a glamor
over his character that impressed the smallest Corner
House girl.
</p>
<p>
One day she met him on Willow Street, some
distance from the old Corner House. He was idly
watching a man across the street who was moving
along the sidewalk in a very odd way indeed.
</p>
<p>
The Kenways had lived in a very poor part of
Bloomingsburg before coming to Milton, and there
had been saloons in the neighborhood; but Dot had
been very small, and if she had seen such a thing
as an intoxicated man she had forgotten it. Near
the Corner House there were no saloons, although
the city of Milton licensed many of those places.
Dot had not before seen a man under the influence
of liquor.
</p>
<p>
This unfortunate was not a poorly dressed man.
Indeed, he was rather well appareled and normally
might have been a very respectable citizen. But
he was staggering from side to side of the walk,
his head hanging and his stiff derby hat—by some
remarkable power—sticking to his head, although
it threatened to fall off at every jerk.
</p>
<p>
“Why—ee!” gasped the smallest Corner House
girl, “what ever is the matter with that poor man,
Sammy Pinkney, do you suppose?”
</p>
<p>
Sammy, trying to wrap his limbs about a fire-plug
in emulation of a boa-constrictor, jerked out:
</p>
<p>
“Brick in his hat!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! <em>What</em>?” murmured the puzzled Dot, eyeing
the poor man wonderingly and clasping the
Alice-doll closer.
</p>
<p>
Sammy grinned. He was a tantalizing urchin
and loved to mystify the innocent Dot.
</p>
<p>
“He’s carrying a brick in his hat,” he repeated,
with daring.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why——Doesn’t he <em>know</em> it?” demanded
the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“I guess nobody’s told him yet,” chuckled
Sammy.
</p>
<p>
At that moment the intoxicated man just caught
his hat from tumbling off by striking it with the
palm of one hand and so settling it well down upon
his ears again.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” murmured the startled Dot. “It
came pretty near falling out, didn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“He, he!” snickered Sammy.
</p>
<p>
“Do you suppose he <em>wants</em> to carry that brick
in his hat?” asked Dot, seriously. “I shouldn’t
think he would.”
</p>
<p>
“He don’t know he’s got it,” said Sammy.
</p>
<p>
“Why doesn’t somebody tell him?” demanded
Dot. “The poor man! He’ll surely fall down.”
</p>
<p>
Sammy still snickered. Somebody should have
spanked Sammy, right then and there!
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care!” exclaimed Dot, more and more
disturbed, “it doesn’t seem nice—not at all. I
think you ought to tell him, Sammy.”
</p>
<p>
“Not me!”
</p>
<p>
“Well——” Dot looked all around. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
was nobody else in sight just then. Willow Street
was quite deserted.
</p>
<p>
“If you won’t, then I must,” declared the little
girl, shouldering the obligation pluckily and starting
across the street.
</p>
<p>
“Aw, Dot! Let him alone,” muttered Sammy.
</p>
<p>
The young rascal was suddenly startled. He
began to wonder what would happen to him if his
mother learned that he had been trying to fool
Dot Kenway in any such way as this.
</p>
<p>
“Come back!” he called after her.
</p>
<p>
“Sha’n’t!” declared Dot, who could be stubborn
when she wanted to be.
</p>
<p>
“Say! that man won’t listen to you,” insisted
Sammy.
</p>
<p>
Dot kept right on. The man had halted, and
was clinging to a tree box, his head hanging down.
His face was very much flushed and his eyes were
glassy.
</p>
<p>
“But I s’pose,” thought Dot, “if <em>I</em> was carrying
a brick in my hat it would make <em>me</em> sick, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Mister!” she said to the man, stopping in the
gutter and looking up at him.
</p>
<p>
“Huh? What’s matter?” asked the man. His
head jerked up and he looked all around to see
who had spoken to him.
</p>
<p>
“Mister,” said Dot, earnestly, “I—I hope
you’ll ‘scuse me, but there’s a brick in your hat.
Sammy Pinkney says so. And I think if you take
it out you’ll feel ever so much better.”
</p>
<p>
Sammy heard her. He actually grew pale, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
casting a startled glance around him, he ran. He
ran all the way home, for he could not imagine
what the man would say or do to Dot. Sammy
was not a very brave boy.
</p>
<p>
The unfortunate man looked down at Dot,
finally having discovered her whereabouts, with
preternatural gravity.
</p>
<p>
“Say—little girl—say that ’gain, will you?” he
said, slowly.
</p>
<p>
Dot quite innocently repeated it. The man
carefully removed his hat and looked into it.
Then he turned it over and shook it. Nothing, of
course, fell to the ground.
</p>
<p>
“’Tisn’t there. You fooled yourself. I
thought so,” muttered the man.
</p>
<p>
And then he leaned so far over that he dropped
the hat in the gutter.
</p>
<p>
“You must be dreadful sick,” Dot said to him,
her little heart touched by his appearance.
</p>
<p>
“Yes—that’s it. Sick. That’s it,” he mumbled.
</p>
<p>
This was a really awful adventure for little
Dot Kenway.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to get you a glass of water,” she
said. “Your face is so red. You <em>are</em> sick, I can
see.”
</p>
<p>
He said nothing, but blinked at her. Perhaps
he did not at first quite understand. Dot turned
to cross the street toward the store on the corner.
Then she turned back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
</p>
<p>
“Will you please hold my Alice-doll while I
go for the water?” she asked the man. “Do be
very careful with her—please.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” said the man, good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll truly, truly be very careful of her?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure will,” repeated the unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
So, after she had placed the doll carefully in
his arms, the little girl tripped away on her errand
of mercy. The man sat down on the curb
and held it. It might have been a laughable situation—only
no thinking person could have laughed.
</p>
<p>
The man nursed the doll as tenderly as Dot
would have done herself. He rocked to and fro
on the curb, hugging the battered doll and looking
down at it earnestly.
</p>
<p>
Nobody had yet noticed the incident—save
Sammy Pinkney; and Sammy Pinkney had run
away.
</p>
<p>
Dot was bold in the cause of any one in need,
if she was not bold for herself. She asked for
the glass of cold water and obtained it. She
brought it carefully back to the man on the curbstone,
holding the glass in both her dimpled hands.
</p>
<p>
His face was still very red, but his eyes were
no longer glassy. He looked at the child with a
shamed expression slowly dawning in his countenance,
and his eyes were moist with tears.
</p>
<p>
“You’d better take your doll, little girl, and
get away from me,” he said, but not roughly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” said Dot, determinedly. “I must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
help you. I know you must be very sick. You
ought to see our Dr. Forsyth. He could make
you well quick, I know.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess <em>you</em> can cure me as quickly as a doctor,”
said the man, hanging his head. “I—I had
a little girl like you once.”
</p>
<p>
“Now drink some of this,” urged Dot, without
noticing the man’s last remark, and offering the
glass of water.
</p>
<p>
He took it in a trembling hand and raised it to
his lips. The little girl reached for the Alice-doll,
but watched him carefully.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t spill it,” she said, “and don’t drink it
all. I think if I put some on your face you’d feel
better.”
</p>
<p>
Immediately she produced a diminutive handkerchief,
folded just as it had been ironed, and
when she took back the glass, she dipped the bit
of muslin in the water remaining in it.
</p>
<p>
Then with tender hand she wiped his hot face;
and she wiped away two big tears, too, that
started down his cheeks. She was still engaged
in thus playing the Good Samaritan when a
swiftly moving motor car coming through Willow
Street was suddenly brought to a stop beside
them.
</p>
<p>
There was a thin, wiry fellow at the steering
wheel. The goggles he wore half disguised him.
In the tonneau sat a fat, prosperous looking man
smoking a big, black cigar.
</p>
<p>
“That’s him, ain’t it, Joe?” asked the fat man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
nodding toward the man sitting on the curbstone.
</p>
<p>
“Yep. That’s him,” rejoined the chauffeur.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, Mr. Maynard!” exclaimed the fat man.
“Get up and get in here. I want to talk to you.”
</p>
<p>
The fast sobering man looked up, saw the
speaker, and did not look particularly pleased.
He tried to rise. Although his brain was fast
clearing, his limbs were still wabbly.
</p>
<p>
“Get out and boost him in here,” said the fat
man, in a low tone to the chauffeur.
</p>
<p>
The latter hopped out. He came quickly to the
aid of Mr. Maynard, and pushed little Dot Kenway
rudely aside. The man still held the doll.
</p>
<p>
“Say! you don’t want that thing!” muttered
the chauffeur, and he seized the doll and flung it
disdainfully upon the ground.
</p>
<p>
Dot uttered a scream of terror. At that moment
Agnes and Neale O’Neil, the latter carrying
the girl’s schoolbooks, came around the corner.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—THE BIG TOUR IS PLANNED</h2>
<p>
Mr. Maynard, as the fat man had called Dot’s
new acquaintance, grumbled something or other
at the chauffeur because of his treatment of the
Alice-doll; but he was not yet quite himself and
the fellow merely laughed and urged Maynard
toward the car. The fat man laughed, too.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, Mr. Maynard. We’ll take you
home,” said the big man, holding open the door
of the tonneau.
</p>
<p>
Just as Neale O’Neil and Agnes reached the
spot, the chauffeur pushed Maynard in and
stepped quickly into his own place.
</p>
<p>
“Say! what did you do to this little girl?” demanded
Neale, with some heat, addressing the
chauffeur.
</p>
<p>
The fellow did not answer; neither did the big
man; and Maynard had tumbled into a seat without
a word. Dot had already picked up her doll;
it was not hurt. The car started and rolled away.
</p>
<p>
“The mean thing!” exclaimed Neale. “Don’t
cry, Dot.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I’m not going to,” sobbed the smallest Corner
House girl. “I don’t b’lieve they’ll be kind
to that man. He’s awful sick.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who is?” asked Neale quickly, exchanging
glances with Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“That man they took away. I got him a drink
of water. But Sammy Pinkney told a story ’bout
him.”
</p>
<p>
“What did Sammy say?” asked Agnes, but her
attention scarcely on what Dot was saying.
</p>
<p>
The little girl told her. “But he was sick. I
know it. I got him a drink of water. He wasn’t
carrying a brick at all.”
</p>
<p>
Neale had grinned faintly; but his face was
quickly sober again.
</p>
<p>
“I know who that Mr. Maynard is,” he said.
“He used to work in the court house. I believe
he was in Mr. Collinger’s office—and he was a
real nice man once.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, he is now,” cried Dot, listening with
very sharp ears. “Only he is sick.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you are right, Dottie,” agreed Neale,
still gravely, but speaking to Agnes. “Anyhow,
he lost his wife and then his little girl. He’s
gone all to pieces, they say. It’s an awfully sad
case. And do you know who that big man is?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Agnes, still unnoticing and gazing
after the disappearing car.
</p>
<p>
“That’s Jim Brady. He’s a ward leader on
the other side of town. He’s very powerful in
politics——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” cried Agnes, suddenly, seizing
her friend’s arm.
</p>
<p>
“Hul-<em>lo</em>! What’s the matter?” asked Neale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you know who that fellow was that drove
the car? Did you see him?”
</p>
<p>
“No-o. I didn’t notice him much. He had
dust goggles on——”
</p>
<p>
“I know! I know!” cried the excited girl.
“They concealed his face a good deal. But I saw
the freckles.”
</p>
<p>
“The freckles?” repeated Neale, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Of course. It was that freckled fellow
who spoke to Ruth that day.”
</p>
<p>
“Not Joe Dawson?” cried the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. If that’s his real name. Oh, Neale!
Let’s have him arrested.”
</p>
<p>
“Cricky!” ejaculated the surprised youth.
“Arrest your aunt!”
</p>
<p>
Agnes burst out laughing at that—serious as
she was. “Aunt Sarah Maltby certainly did not
steal Mr. Collinger’s motor car,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Well. We don’t know that Saleratus Joe
did,” grinned Neale. “Come on home. Don’t cry
any more, Dot. Just the same I would like to
punch that fellow who threw down your doll.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t we find out who he is—all about him?”
demanded Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe. That Mr. Maynard knows him, I
s’pose. I could ask him. I used to clean Mr.
Maynard’s yard and sidewalks for him. I’ll see,”
promised Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
When the trio reached the Corner House that
day, however, they found a subject afoot that put
out of Neale’s and Agnes’ minds for the time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
being all thought of the stealing of Mr. Collinger’s
car. And yet the county surveyor’s aunt had
something to do with this very interesting topic
under discussion.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard was present, having a neighborly
cup of tea with Mrs. MacCall, who was quite as
much a friend of the family as she was housekeeper.
Mr. Howbridge had chanced to drop in
as well, and Ruth had arrived home ahead of the
other Corner House girls.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aggie!” cried Ruth, running out of the
sitting room where tea was being served, Uncle
Rufus having rolled the service table in there at
Mrs. MacCall’s request. “Just guess!”
</p>
<p>
“Going to have rice waffles for supper,” put in
Neale, with a cheerful grin.
</p>
<p>
“That boy!” said the oldest girl, scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“What <em>has</em> happened?” demanded Agnes, excitedly.
Ruth was seldom given to exuberance of
speech or action, and she was plainly stirred up
now.
</p>
<p>
“He says we can do it!”
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” grunted Neale, staring.
</p>
<p>
“Who says we can do what?” demanded Agnes,
her blue eyes almost as wide as saucers. “How
you talk, Ruth Kenway!”
</p>
<p>
“It will be most delightful, I am sure,” said
the older girl, more composedly. “We shall all enjoy
it. And Mrs. Heard has agreed to act as chaperone,
for Mrs. MacCall <em>can’t</em> go, and you know
how Aunt Sarah Maltby feels about the auto.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I see,” grumbled Neale. “A glimmer of
intelligence reaches my brain. You are talking
about the trip in the auto after school closes.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that it?” cried Agnes, clasping her hands.
“Oh, Ruthie!”
</p>
<p>
“That is it, my dear! Mr. Howbridge just
spoke about it himself. He has known Mrs. Heard
for years, you see, and he thinks she would be
just the nicest person in the world to go with us.”
</p>
<p>
“And so she is,” agreed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Dot, who had listened in grave silence,
“if we are going off on a long journey with
our car, my Alice-doll must have her complexion
‘tended to. You take her, Neale, and get her doctored,”
and she thrust the precious doll directly
into the boy’s hands, and marched out of the room
with quivering lip. It was really very hard for
the smallest Corner House girl to part from her
most loved child even in such an emergency.
</p>
<p>
“There now! What did I tell you?” demanded
Agnes, of Neale. “You’ve got your hands full.”
</p>
<p>
“Of doll,” he admitted, but he did not appear
rueful. “I know just where they will fix her up
as good as new,” and he laughed. “I believe in
preparedness. I foresaw this when I spoke about
the doll the other day.”
</p>
<p>
But now was the time to talk about the tour.
Agnes had prepared for this since the very first
day she knew they were to have the automobile.
The height of her ambition was to travel in the
most modern way—by motor car.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
With Neale—and sometimes aided by her sisters—she
had planned elaborate routes through
the surrounding country—sometimes into neighboring
states. She had borrowed maps and guide
books galore and had purchased not a few. In
fact, in a desultory way, she and Neale had picked
up a smattering of knowledge of roads and towns
and hotels and general geographical information
which really might be of use if, as Ruth said they
would, the Corner House girls should go on a tour
in the new seven-passenger car.
</p>
<p>
They talked about it to the exclusion of almost
everything else that evening, and Agnes spread
the news abroad at school the next day. That
the Corner House girls really owned a car was
already an important fact to their school friends.
</p>
<p>
For Ruth and Agnes were not likely to be selfish
in their enjoyment of their new possession.
Stinginess was not a fault in the Kenway family.
</p>
<p>
On the very second Saturday after they had
come into possession of the car Neale had taken
out the older girls and a party of their friends
in the morning, and in the afternoon Tess and
Dot had played hostesses to a lot of little girls.
As Mr. Howbridge remarked with a laugh, the
cost of the new car was a mere drop in the bucket.
Maintenance and gasoline were the items that
would deplete the pocketbooks of his wards.
</p>
<p>
As for Neale O’Neil, he almost lived in the car.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the entire family had to try it—even
to Linda. Linda enjoyed it, and in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
broken English stated it as her opinion that
“heafen could be not like dis.” Which was a
statement not to be contradicted.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall was doubtful about the utility of
the machine after all. Uncle Rufus, when he went
out with Neale and the little girls and not a few
of the pets, including a couple of kittens and Tom
Jonah, just clung to the seat-rail with both hands
and actually turned gray about the corners of his
mouth.
</p>
<p>
As for Aunt Sarah Maltby, she had set her face
against the innovation from the first.
</p>
<p>
“But of course,” she said, in her severe way,
“it doesn’t matter what <em>I</em> say or what my opinion
may be. Nobody asks me to advise. I am a non-entity
in this house.”
</p>
<p>
That was the beginning. Ruth and Agnes and
even Mrs. MacCall had to coax and plead and cajole
before the old lady would promise to take a
ride in the car. When she did, she dressed in her
Sunday dress—the one she always went to church
in—and carried her prayer-book.
</p>
<p>
<em>This</em> was a state of “preparedness” that
amused Agnes and Neale very much. Aunt Sarah
evidently expected the worst. She even carried
in her pocket the peppermint lozenges which she
always took to church with her and nibbled at in
sermon time.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Aunt Sarah, who was a pessimist at the
best of times, approached the ordeal in such a way
that Ruth really began to pity her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care! she’d spoil all our fun,” protested
Agnes, exasperated.
</p>
<p>
But the older sister said: “Perhaps she can’t
help it after all, Aggie. And if she really is
scared, I am sorry.”
</p>
<p>
At that Agnes whispered sharply: “Look at
her face!”
</p>
<p>
Neale was running the car carefully, but at a
good speed, on one of the pleasantest and smoothest
highways around Milton. The air was invigorating,
the outlook was beautiful, and the car
ran like a charm.
</p>
<p>
In a moment of forgetfulness, perhaps, Aunt
Sarah’s grim countenance had changed. It did
actually seem as though there was a smile hovering
about her lips. To the two girls who rode
with her in the tonneau it seemed as though it
must be impossible for anybody not to enjoy the
ride.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it splendid, Aunt Sarah?” queried Ruth,
with shining eyes, leaning toward the old woman.
</p>
<p>
Instantly Aunt Sarah’s face became—as usual—forbidding.
She shook her head with determination.
</p>
<p>
“No, Niece Ruth, it is nothing of the kind,” she
declared. “I do not like it at all. I knew I
shouldn’t. I wish to return.”
</p>
<p>
“Well!” Agnes had gasped in her sister’s ear.
“Don’t try to tell me! If Aunt Sarah was not
almost laughing then, why, then her face slipped!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—WHAT SAMMY DID</h2>
<p>
School had closed, and the long and glorious
vacation had been ushered in. The Corner House
girls had now lived in Milton for two years, and
felt very much at home.
</p>
<p>
They knew many people—Agnes said: “A
whole raft of people,” but Ruth did not approve
of such language and accused her fly-away sister
of learning it from Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Neale! Must he be blamed for all my
sins?” asked Agnes, with a wry smile. She was
mending a tear in a very good skirt—and she did
not like to sew.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I will not accuse him of being the cause
of <em>that</em>, Aggie,” said Ruth, pointing to the tear.
</p>
<p>
“You’re wrong,” retorted her sister with a sudden
elfish smile. “If he had not chased me, to
get those cherries I stole from him, I wouldn’t
have caught my skirt on the nail and ‘tored’ it,
as Dot would say.”
</p>
<p>
“Tomboy!” declared Ruth, rather scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care,” Agnes said, biting off her
thread. “I hope I’ll never be starched and
stiff.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you are getting older,” went on Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Not too decrepit to run yet,” retorted Agnes,
pertly.
</p>
<p>
Ruth laughed at that, and pinched her sister’s
rosy cheek. “Nevertheless,” she said, “that is
one of the skirts you will be obliged to wear on
our tour.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Our tour!” cried Agnes, ecstatically,
clasping her hands. “Ouch!”
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter?” demanded Ruth,
startled by her sister’s squeal.
</p>
<p>
“Stuck my finger with this horrid needle,”
mumbled Agnes, sucking the pricked digit.
</p>
<p>
She went back to her sewing as Ruth went out
of the room. In came Neale in cap, goggles, and
leggings.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! Have you got the car out?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Aggie!” cried the boy, without replying
to her question, and eyeing the work in her lap
askance. “I am surprised! You’re just like
Satan—as we had it in our lesson last Sunday—aren’t
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Well! I like your impudence. In what way,
please?” demanded Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Why, you’re sewing tears, aren’t you?”
chuckled Neale. “And the Bible says the Evil
One ‘sowed tares.’”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t! It’s too great a shock. But, are
you going out with the car?”
</p>
<p>
“Been out,” said the boy. “I took Mr. Howbridge
over to Brenton Woods to catch the train
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
for the West on the Q. V. We won’t see him
again until we’re back from our tour.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes! Our tour!” repeated Agnes; but
this time she did not clasp her hands in ecstasy.
She looked at her pricked finger ruefully instead.
</p>
<p>
“And coming back,” went on Neale, “I happened
to run across Mr. Maynard.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes!” cried Agnes again, but in an entirely
different tone.
</p>
<p>
“He’d been fishing. You see, he doesn’t have
much to do now that he’s out of the surveyor’s
office. That’s why he—he gets into trouble so
much, I suppose. That and worrying about the
death of his wife and baby. I brought him home
in the car.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you ask him about that Joe fellow?”
</p>
<p>
“Saleratus Joe?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. If that’s what you are bound to call
him,” Agnes said.
</p>
<p>
“I did. Mr. Maynard doesn’t know the fellow
personally. He didn’t seem to remember much
about that day he met Dot. He remembers her,
though,” Neale said, thoughtfully. “Asked about
her in a shamefaced sort of way.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think he would be ashamed.”
</p>
<p>
“He is to be pitied,” said the boy, soberly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes. I suppose so. All such men are.
But for little Dot to get mixed up with a drunken
man——”
</p>
<p>
“It didn’t hurt her,” said Neale, stoutly.
“And maybe it has helped him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
Agnes took a minute to digest this; and she
made no further comment. But she asked:
</p>
<p>
“How about that Joe? Doesn’t Mr. Maynard
know anything about him?”
</p>
<p>
“He says not. Suppose we tell Mrs. Heard,
and she’ll tell Mr. Collinger. Joe Dawson has
sometimes worked for Jim Brady, the big politician.
Mr. Collinger must know if Brady is one
of the men who have been trying to get those
maps and the papers away from him.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Agnes, “I hope we can help bring
those auto thieves to book.”
</p>
<p>
“Guess Mr. Collinger is more worried about
his maps—if they got them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! suppose they should steal our car?
Wouldn’t it be dreadful? We must catch them.”
</p>
<p>
Neale laughed. “You’re going to be a regular
detective when you grow up, Aggie. I can see
that,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Put up the hammer, little boy,” advised Agnes.
“Do you know that it has been decided when we
are to start on our tour?”
</p>
<p>
“No. When?”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Heard telephoned that she will be ready
to-morrow. We shall start some time the following
day, so Ruthie just said.”
</p>
<p>
“Good!” declared the boy. “Say, Aggie!
we’re bound to have a dandy time.”
</p>
<p>
“Even if we weren’t, I should be glad to get
away from this place,” said the girl, suddenly a
little cross.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why?” asked Neale O’Neil, in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Because of that pest, Sammy Pinkney.”
</p>
<p>
“What about him?”
</p>
<p>
“He is fairly hounding us to death,” said Agnes,
with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
“What about?”
</p>
<p>
“He has begged to go with us every hour—almost—since
he first heard we were going on a long
trip in our auto.” Then she suddenly giggled.
“Oh, Neale! He has decided that it would be
more fun to be an auto pirate than a salt water
buccaneer of the old school.”
</p>
<p>
“One great kid that,” chuckled Neale, appreciatively.
</p>
<p>
“But he is an awful nuisance. He bothers the
little girls whenever they go out of the house.
He’s told his mother he’s going with us—and I
suppose Mrs. Pinkney half believes we have invited
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Cricky!” chuckled Neale again. “I imagine
she’d be glad to get rid of him for a few weeks.”
</p>
<p>
“My, goodness, me!” exclaimed the startled
Agnes. “She sha’n’t get rid of him at <em>our</em> expense—no,
sir! I won’t hear of it. Neither will
Ruth. And, besides, there isn’t going to be
breathing space in that car after we all pile in—with
Tom Jonah and the baggage, too.”
</p>
<p>
“I have an idea!” said Neale, wickedly, “that
we ought to have an auto truck trailing us with all
the furbelows and what-nots you girls will think
it necessary to carry.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Smarty!” Agnes scoffed. “Remember
we went camping last summer and we know something
about what to take with us and what not
to take.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right,” said Neale. “But the Corner
House girls are not going to live under canvas
this time—that is, not much. At the fancy hotels
you’ll all want to cut a dash. How are you going
to do it?”
</p>
<p>
Agnes laughed at him. “Don’t you suppose all
that has been thought of?” she demanded. “Mrs.
Heard will send a trunk, and so shall we, by express
to the Polo House at Granthan. That is
going to be our first ‘fancy’ hotel, as you call
them. Then, when we leave there, the trunks will
be shipped on to our next fashionable roosting
place. But, oh, dear me! I don’t care much
about the hotels. I want to be moving,” declared
this very modern young American girl.
</p>
<p>
“Cricky!” grumbled Neale. “I bet if you have
your way we’ll get pinched for speeding in every
county in the state.”
</p>
<p>
Every waking hour thereafter, until, on the second
day, the car was brought to the side gate of
the Corner House premises, was a busy hour for
the four Kenways and Neale O’Neil. Mrs. Heard
came over with her personal baggage, for the
route the party was to follow would not take them
anywhere near her home. Besides, it was better
to pack the car carefully before the start was
made, and thus find out where every piece of baggage—as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
well as every passenger—was to be
placed.
</p>
<p>
The car was roomy and comfortable; but bags
and suitcases of all descriptions—to say nothing
of an excited Newfoundland dog—were bound to
occupy much space.
</p>
<p>
Neale declared he had groomed the car “to the
nines”—and it looked it. It was new enough, in
any case, for everything about it to shine and
glisten. A good mechanician from the public
garage had been over it the day before and pronounced
every part in perfect working order.
</p>
<p>
“But that doesn’t mean that we can’t get a
blow-out before going a mile,” growled Neale, who
had worked so hard that he was rather pessimistic.
“But, come on, girls, bring out the rest of
the household furniture. You seem to have half
the contents of the Corner House packed in already.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth calmly ignored this, and went about final
arrangements in her usual capable manner. Nothing
would be forgotten, nothing overlooked when
Ruth Kenway was in charge.
</p>
<p>
The little girls were just as busy in their way
as their sisters. Tess and Dot were too much excited
and far too much taken up with their own
affairs, to pay any attention to Sammy Pinkney.
</p>
<p>
But that hopeful youngster stuck to Ruth and
Agnes like a burr—and a very annoying one.
</p>
<p>
“Aw, say! let a feller go!” was his mildest way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
of pleading for space in the automobile for his
own small self. “I won’t get in your way.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Ruth, with the same decision she
had expressed from the first. “No.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, Aggie! <em>you know me!</em> If <em>you</em> say I can,
I can.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re the biggest bother in the world, Sammy
Pinkney!” declared the second oldest Corner
House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Won’t bother you a mite. I’ll help. I’ll run
errands——”
</p>
<p>
“What errands, I’d like to know?” scoffed
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Well—you’ll want somebody to run ’em when
the car breaks down——”
</p>
<p>
That settled it! Agnes would not listen to him
any further.
</p>
<p>
“Say! I’ll give Dot my bicycle if you’ll let me
go,” he urged on Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“I’d be afraid to have her ride it,” laughed
Ruth. “The only thing you ever did give the little
girls, Sammy—that goat—has been a dreadful
annoyance.”
</p>
<p>
“Give us your bulldog, Sammy?” suggested
Agnes, knowing that the very soul of the boy was
knit to that ugly, bandy-legged beast.
</p>
<p>
“Ow!” groaned Sammy. He could not agree
to that. “I tell you I’ll do anything you want
me to——”
</p>
<p>
“Stay at home, then, and don’t bother us,”
said Ruth, somewhat tartly for her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
“Aw, <em>do</em> say I can go, Aggie,” he pleaded for
the last time with the other sister.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to see you find room aboard that
car!” cried Agnes, having finally packed the last
bag and parcel in the tonneau.
</p>
<p>
At these words Sammy shot away like a rabbit
and disappeared. Mrs. Heard and the little girls
came out. Everybody else from the Corner
House appeared to bid the party good-bye—even
Aunt Sarah.
</p>
<p>
“It’ll rain before you get far,” prophesied this
last person, grimly, “and you’ll have to come
back.”
</p>
<p>
She would not admit that an automobile was
fit to travel in during wet weather.
</p>
<p>
“What <em>have</em> you got in that basket?” demanded
Agnes of Tess, suddenly pouncing upon the serious
little girl.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aggie! Only two of Sandyface’s grandchildren.
You know, we haven’t found names for
them yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Two kittens!” gasped Agnes. “What do you
know about that, Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“How about Billy Bumps, too?” said Neale,
looking perfectly sober.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he and Tom Jonah would fight,” said Dot,
proudly bearing her renovated Alice-doll in a
brand new coat and hat. The Alice-doll really
was a pleasure to look upon once more. Only,
whereas her hair had originally been dark, now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
it was very blonde indeed, to match her pink
cheeks and blue eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, it isn’t very respectaful,” admitted
the smallest Corner House girl, in speaking of the
change in Alice’s appearance. “But ladies <em>do</em>
bleach their hair and make it blond; and Alice
always <em>did love</em> to be fashionable.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Tess had been convinced by Ruth
that an automobile tour was no place for two kittens.
Tom Jonah was being taken along as a
means of safety for the car. Agnes was quite
sure herself that automobile thieves were only
waiting their chance to steal this brand new motor
car.
</p>
<p>
They all got into the car at last—Mrs. Heard,
Ruth and the two smaller girls in the tonneau,
heaped about with baggage, but comfortable.
Tom Jonah crouched under Agnes’ feet in front,
where she sat beside Neale, his head sticking out
of the car and his tongue displayed like a pink
woolen necktie.
</p>
<p>
Everybody shouted “good-bye!” There were
plenty of neighbors to call after the touring party.
And those on the street, for the first few blocks,
seemed to be greatly amazed and amused by the
passage of the Corner House automobile.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” ejaculated Agnes, in some disgust,
and trying to sit up primly, “what do you suppose
is the matter with folks, anyway? One
would think we were a circus parade.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
</p>
<p>
“Humph! guess we do look funny,” chuckled
Neale. “I once saw a picture supposed to represent
the good ship <em>Mayflower</em> as she must have
appeared off Plymouth Rock, if all the antique furniture
you hear about really was brought over
by the Pilgrims, as people claim. They had to
hang chairs and tables and highboys and lowboys
and such things from her spars, besides having an
awful deckload. And I reckon we look like a
large family on moving day,” finished the boy,
with an expansive grin.
</p>
<p>
“We do <em>not!</em>” exclaimed Agnes, quite put out.
“Look at that old gentleman stare. What’s he
saying—and shaking his cane, too?”
</p>
<p>
“Got me,” returned her comrade on the front
seat.
</p>
<p>
He increased the car’s speed and they passed
people too quickly for the latter to make themselves
heard—if what some of them shouted was
of importance. The passing of the Corner House
motor car seemed to interest and please the
urchins along the way more than anybody else.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” murmured Mrs. Heard, “I never
was so much stared at before, I do believe. What
do you suppose is the matter with us?”
</p>
<p>
“They must all want to ride with us,” said Tess,
quite composedly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, they just can’t!” cried Dot. “See that
boy running and yelling, will you? Why, he
can’t catch up.”
</p>
<p>
Once out of the city Neale (of course urgently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
pressed by Agnes) “let her out another notch,”
as he expressed it. The car ran as smoothly as
though the road was macadamized—although few
highways about Milton were so well made as that.
But Neale was a careful and skillful driver already,
and the springs of the car were excellent.
</p>
<p>
On and on the handsome car rushed, leaving
little spirals of dust behind it, and sending the
small fry of rural animal life scurrying out of
its path. The peculiar interest shown by pedestrians
as they passed through the town, was continued
out in the country.
</p>
<p>
As Neale slowed down for a railroad crossing,
taking it easily and carefully, although there was
no train near and the gates were up, a boy yelled:
</p>
<p>
“Hi, there! Whip behind! Whip behind, mister!”
</p>
<p>
“Now! how foolish that is,” gasped Agnes, as
they jolted a little going over the rails. “What
do you suppose that little imp meant?”
</p>
<p>
Neale only grunted. He was thinking, and although
he increased the speed of the car a little,
it was only for a short distance. Then he shut
her down suddenly—and stopped.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” demanded Agnes, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going, Neale?” asked Ruth,
as the boy crept out from behind the wheel,
stepped over Agnes’ feet and the dog, and leaped
out into the road.
</p>
<p>
“I want to see something,” muttered Neale. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
went to the rear of the car. Then he uttered a
shout:
</p>
<p>
“Come and look at this, will you? What do
you suppose that kid has done?”
</p>
<p>
“What kid?” asked Agnes, following him nimbly
out of the car. Tom Jonah bounded out, too,
glad, probably, to stretch his cramped limbs.
</p>
<p>
“Sammy Pinkney!” said Neale, pushing back
his dust mask and staring.
</p>
<p>
Ruth stood up to see over the folded-back top
of the car. “What is it?” she demanded, unable
to see anything.
</p>
<p>
But Agnes arrived beside Neale, and saw perfectly.
“Well! I never!” she ejaculated.
“Sammy Pinkney! how <em>dared</em> you? What are
you doing here?”
</p>
<p>
For Sammy was roosting, more or less comfortably,
on the back of the car, and had a bright,
new russet leather suitcase tied on beside him with
a bit of rope. He presented a grinning, dusty, befreckled
face to Neale and the Corner House girl.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—REFORMING A “PIRATE”</h2>
<p>
“Well! you said I could come, Aggie Kenway—so
there!”
</p>
<p>
This was Sammy’s initial statement when
Neale dragged him off his perch and brought him
around to the side of the car where all could see
him.
</p>
<p>
“Why! you awful boy! I never!” declared
Agnes, shaking her head at him angrily.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you did,” repeated Sammy.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t add to your wickedness by telling such
a story, Sammy Pinkney,” admonished Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sammy!” gasped Tess, dolefully.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe even pirates tell stories,”
added Dot, with grave conviction.
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t! I ain’t telling a story,” repeated the
small boy, with earnestness. “She did! she
did!”
</p>
<p>
“I never! I never!” responded Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Wait!” put in Ruth, firmly. “We are getting
nowhere. Of course you did not tell him he
could come, Aggie; but he must have thought you
said something like that. What <em>did</em> she say,
Sammy Pinkney?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
“She said—she said,” choked the now much-abused-sounding
Sammy. “She said she’d like
to see me find room aboard the car—<em>and I did!</em>”
and he concluded with something like triumph.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I never!” exclaimed Mrs. Heard, and
it must be confessed she was immensely amused.
“What a boy!”
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever hear the like of that?” repeated
Ruth, using one of Mrs. MacCall’s favorite expressions
of amazement.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure I didn’t mean——” began Agnes,
but her older sister said, quickly:
</p>
<p>
“Of course you didn’t, deary! And that boy
should have known better.”
</p>
<p>
“She <em>did</em> tell me so—she did!” wailed Sammy.
“And I’m going. My mother said I could—and
that you girls was awful nice to take me.”
</p>
<p>
“Cricky!” murmured Neale, all of a broad grin
now. “You got a reputation that time, Aggie,
for goodness, without meaning it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care——”
</p>
<p>
“The thing is now,” interrupted Ruth, decidedly,
“how to send him home.”
</p>
<p>
At that Sammy lifted up his voice in a wail
that might have touched a heart of stone. And
really, after all, there was not a heart of stone in
the whole party of tourists from the old Corner
House—not even in Tom Jonah’s breast. The
old dog went up to Sammy and tried to lap his
tears away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, see here, kid! don’t yell like that,” begged
Neale. “Turn off the sprinkler. That won’t get
you anywhere.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you tell me what we are to do with him,
then?” demanded Ruth, quite put out. “There is
no room for him in the car.”
</p>
<p>
“I can stay where I was. I don’t mind,”
gulped Sammy.
</p>
<p>
“Never!” declared Agnes. “You made a show
out of us all the way through town. We’ll never
hear the last of it.”
</p>
<p>
“We were boarded by a pirate, sure enough,”
chuckled Neale.
</p>
<p>
“He’s worse than any pirate,” sighed Ruth.
“We’d know what to do with a real pirate.”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder?” murmured Neale, his eyes twinkling.
</p>
<p>
But Ruth ignored him. She thought she saw
her duty, and was determined to do it. “I suppose
we shall have to go back,” she hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, Ruthie!” begged the two little girls
in chorus.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t go back for that horrid little
scamp!” snapped Agnes, her face flushing.
“Sammy Pinkney, you are the worst boy!”
</p>
<p>
Sammy sniffed and looked at her. “I found
that ring you lost that time, Aggie Kenway.
’Member?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“But you <em>are</em> an awful nuisance,” pronounced
Ruth, with conviction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
“You never would have knowed your hens was
layin’ in Mr. Benjamin’s lot last week if I hadn’t
ha’ told you, Ruthie Kenway—so there,” responded
the youngster.
</p>
<p>
“And you told me that—that sick man was carrying
a brick in his hat—and he wasn’t,” Dot put
in faintly.
</p>
<p>
Sammy grinned at that; but he was prompt to
say, too: “Well, who found all your dolls out
on the grass where you’d played lawn party, and
brought ’em in just before the thunder shower
the other day? Heh?”
</p>
<p>
“Cricky!” exclaimed Neale, under his breath,
and with some admiration, “the kid’s making out
a case.”
</p>
<p>
Tess, the kind-hearted, would make no accusation;
but Ruth, despite the boy’s rejoinders, remained
firm.
</p>
<p>
“No,” she said. “He must go home. Is there
a railroad station near from which we can send
him, Neale? We’ll telephone to his mother. We
are a long way from town.”
</p>
<p>
At that Sammy Pinkney, who prided himself
on being “tough” and who was in training for a
piratical future, broke down completely.
</p>
<p>
“Ow! ow! ow!” he howled, digging his grimy
fist first into one eye and then into the other.
“I don’t wanter! I don’t wanter! I don’t
wanter go back. I ain’t got nobody to play with.
And ma’ll lick me ’cause I said you’d ‘vited me
to go—an’ now Aggie s-s-says she didn’t. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
I been sick, anyway, and I can’t play with the fellers,
’cause it tires me so.
</p>
<p>
“I—I—I never git to go nowheres,” pursued
Sammy, using the most atrocious English, but utterly
abandoned in his grief. “You Corner
House girls git all the go—go—good times, and
<em>I</em> ain’t got even a s-s-sister to play with——”
</p>
<p>
At this point a most astonishing thing overtook
Agnes Kenway. She had begun by glaring
at Sammy in anger; but as he went on to bewail
his hard state, her pretty face flushed, then paled;
her blue eyes filled with tears which soon began
to spill over. She drew nearer to the miserable
little chap, standing, dirty and forlorn, in the middle
of the road.
</p>
<p>
“Now, stop that, Sammy!” she suddenly
blurted out. “Just stop. Don’t cry any more.”
</p>
<p>
“He can’t go. There isn’t room,” Ruth was
repeating.
</p>
<p>
Agnes turned toward the eldest Corner House
girl sharply and stamped her foot.
</p>
<p>
“He shall go, Ruth Kenway—so there! He can
squeeze in on the seat between Neale and me.
Here! take that bag up, Neale O’Neil. There’s
room for it right in here,” and she pointed.
“Now! stop your crying, Sammy. You shall go;
but you’ll have to be good.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aggie,” cried the happy youngster, “I’ll
be as good as gold. You’ll see.”
</p>
<p>
“Well!” gasped Ruth, yet not sorry that for
once Agnes had usurped authority.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard laughed. Dot said:
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s true. He <em>hasn’t</em> any sister.”
</p>
<p>
“And I’m sure he <em>can</em> be good,” put in Tess, the
optimist.
</p>
<p>
Neale was chuckling to himself as he put
Sammy’s suitcase in the place indicated.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter with <em>you</em>, Neale O’Neil?”
demanded Agnes, hotly, brushing the tears out of
her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I was just thinking that this party has assumed
a good deal of a contract,” said the light-haired
boy.
</p>
<p>
“What for?”
</p>
<p>
“For reforming a pirate,” said Neale.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—A WAYSIDE BIVOUAC</h2>
<p>
Ruth insisted upon stopping at the first brook
they came to and Sammy was made presentable—his
face and hands scrubbed and his clothing
brushed.
</p>
<p>
“Yuh needn’t be so particular,” said Sammy.
“There’ll more dirt get on me before night.”
</p>
<p>
“Listen to him!” groaned Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard laughed. “That’s what it means
to have a boy in the family. Oh, I know! I
brought up my nephew, Philly, for the most part.
I had to watch him like a cat at a mousehole to
see that he did not go to bed at night without
washing his feet. He <em>would</em> run barefoot.”
</p>
<p>
“One of the penalties of going on this excursion,
young man,” said Agnes to Sammy, “is having
to keep clean. I know it’s going to be hard
sledding for you; but we can’t afford to have a
grubby looking youngster in the party.”
</p>
<p>
Sammy sighed, muttering: “Well! I guess I
can stand it. Ma bathed me all over, <em>every day</em>,
when I was sick. Guess that’s why I’m so thin
now. She purt’ near washed me all away.”
</p>
<p>
The first day’s journey had been carefully laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
out, and the party of tourists from the old Corner
House knew just where they were to stay that
night. They were not to be bound throughout
their tour, however, by hard-and-fast plans or
rules.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a poor rule that can’t be broken,” said
the matter-of-fact Mrs. Heard. “Just the same
we want to know something about where we are
going—sometimes. I wouldn’t fancy being
caught out in some wilderness on a stormy night,
for instance, with nothing better than somebody’s
barn to take refuge in.”
</p>
<p>
This, of course, neither she nor the others realized
at the time was a prophetic statement.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, if one is to go on such an excursion
as this of the Corner House girls, one must have
some idea of the roads, of hotels, and of the choice
of routes and hostelries, as well as distances between
proposed stops.
</p>
<p>
As far as they had been able to learn there was
no hotel on the road they had selected, near which
they would be at noon of this first day. So, in
with the suitcases and other impedimenta, was
packed a lunch hamper.
</p>
<p>
When they stopped by a wayside spring for the
noon bivouac, they were out of sight of every
house and a long way from home. But Neale
O’Neil knew this road.
</p>
<p>
“I was over it the other day with Mr. Howbridge.
Pogue Lake is just back there a couple
of miles. That’s a great fishing place.”

<p>
“I never did see how men and boys could be
cruel enough to fish,” said Mrs. Heard, with a
little shudder. “Always wanting to kill something.
Hooking fish by their poor, tender mouths—it’s
awful!”
</p>
<p>
“I should think it would hurt the worms worse
than it would the fish, Mrs. Heard,” said the
thoughtful Tess. “The long worms get cut in
half—and both ends wriggle so!”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grunted Sammy. “Worms ain’t got
no feelings. No more’n eels. And it don’t hurt
an eel to skin it—so there!”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know how <em>you</em> know so much, young
man,” said Mrs. Heard, tartly. “Did you ever
talk to a skinned eel? Who told you it didn’t
hurt ’em?”
</p>
<p>
Other automobile parties had stopped at this
pleasant spot to picnic, for there were unmistakable
marks of its having been thus occupied. It
seems seldom to occur to picnic parties that other
excursionists may wish to use the same sylvan
spot which they find so lovely and leave in such
disgraceful condition.
</p>
<p>
But the party from the old Corner House was
careful in more ways than one.
</p>
<p>
Strapped to the side of the automobile just over
the step, was a folding tripod of light lacquered
steel rods. From the apex of these when they
were set up, the kettle was hung, for Mrs. Heard
insisted she must have her tea.
</p>
<p>
First, however, Neale O’Neil produced a small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
shovel and prepared a patch of sand on the grass,
on which to build the fire. He was an old hand
at camping out and knew very well that fire could
not spread from a sandpile.
</p>
<p>
Neale had always shown himself to be quick
and handy; but Mrs. Heard was immensely
pleased with his despatch in getting water boiled
and his part of the camping arrangements complete.
Of course, the girls “set the table,” and
even Sammy was made use of. He gathered the
supply of dry fuel, and if Neale had not stopped
him he would have piled up sufficient at the camp
site for a Fourth of July bonfire.
</p>
<p>
It was after the older girls had washed the few
dishes they had used and while they were resting
after the lunch that the first incident of real moment
on this tour of the Corner House girls occurred.
</p>
<p>
A man came tramping through the brush with a
rod in his hand and a creel slung from his shoulder.
He wore long wading boots and he walked
through the brook into which the waters of the
spring trickled, and so reached the automobile
party. Tom Jonah stood up, but did not growl
at him.
</p>
<p>
The man was lifting his cap and going right by
when Dot Kenway uttered a squeal of surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tess! Oh, Aggie!” she cried. “Here’s
my sick man now.”
</p>
<p>
At the same moment Neale O’Neil recognized
the fisherman and shouted to him:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hi, Mr. Maynard! What luck to-day?”
</p>
<p>
The other turned a single glance at Neale and
nodded, his attention immediately becoming fixed
on Dot. He approached her with a smile warming
his countenance, which seemed rather saturnine
in repose.
</p>
<p>
“This is my kind little friend,” he said; and
although his face was deeply flushed it was not
from the same cause as when the smallest Corner
House girl had previously met him. “So you remember
me?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, sir,” Dot replied, a little bashfully,
giving him her hand.
</p>
<p>
“And how is the dolly’s health? But <em>this</em> isn’t
the one?” asked Mr. Maynard, showing that he
had a good memory for some incidents of that
former unfortunate afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes; this is my Alice-doll,” said Dot, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, she doesn’t look the same,” the man declared,
warmly interested.
</p>
<p>
“She has new clothes on—and a new hat.”
</p>
<p>
“I never would have known her again,” went
on Mr. Maynard.
</p>
<p>
“And you couldn’t ever guess what’s happened
to her,” said Dot, seriously.
</p>
<p>
“Her face——?”
</p>
<p>
“She’s been completely cured of a dreadful bad
complexion,” confided Dot. “Neale took her to
a hospital. It is wonderful what they can do to
you nowadays at hospitals,” said the little girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
</p>
<p>
“It is indeed,” agreed Mr. Maynard, taking
the Alice-doll tenderly in his arms.
</p>
<p>
“I saw the place myself,” went on Dot, eagerly.
“There was a big gold sign over the door, ‘Dolls’ Hospital.’ Why!
I didn’t know there were such places.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed?” responded the man, very much interested.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. And they fixed Alice’s face—and her
hair. Of course, she wasn’t a real blonde before;
but it’s fashionable. Like our Aggie, you know,”
pursued the talkative Dot.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Agnes had been whispering eagerly
to Neale and now they both approached Dot and
her friend.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Maynard,” said Neale, “have you see anything
of Saleratus Joe again?”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness, Neale!” exclaimed the fisherman.
“You could have seen both him and Jim
Brady on this road this very morning. They
passed me as I came along to the pond, in that big
car of Brady’s.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard had been attracted by this topic of
conversation. She said:
</p>
<p>
“I believe that horrid Brady brought about the
stealing of my nephew’s car. And he’s shielding
the men who actually did it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about that, Mrs. Heard,” said
Mr. Maynard, who evidently knew the widow.
“He surely didn’t have the car stolen for his own
use,” and he smiled, “for that French machine of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
his cost him forty-five hundred dollars. He told
me so the other day.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you very well acquainted with Brady, Mr.
Maynard?” queried the woman, rather suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“Why—no!” he replied, slowly. “I know most
of the men who hang about the court house; and
Jim thinks he can get me back in the surveyor’s
office. Of course, I should be grateful if he
could.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t for a moment suppose that Brady
wanted my nephew’s car,” said Mrs. Heard,
sharply. “<em>You</em> know that?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—yes,” responded the fisherman again.
</p>
<p>
“But if Brady had it stolen, why hasn’t the
car been found?” Neale put in, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“I told you before,” said Mrs. Heard, promptly.
“They expected to find those road maps. And I
guess they didn’t find ’em,” she added, with a nod
of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“You may be right, Mrs. Heard,” agreed Mr.
Maynard, but evidently desirous of saying no
more.
</p>
<p>
He handed the Alice-doll back to Dot, who, with
Tess, had not been much interested in this discussion,
of course; and he picked up his fishing rod to
depart.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry I did not happen along before you
ate your luncheon,” he said, smiling. “I could
have supplied you with a nice mess of yellow
perch.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Mr. Maynard,” said Agnes, with a
naughty twinkle in her eye. “I’m afraid we
should have had to refuse them, for Mrs. Heard
does not approve of fishing.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! but I am fond of fish, just the
same,” said their chaperone, honestly.
</p>
<p>
“What would you suggest as the least cruel way
of capturing fish?” Mr. Maynard asked, soberly.
</p>
<p>
“How about seining them and then chloroforming
each fish?” whispered Neale to Agnes.
</p>
<p>
But the widow laughed, saying to the fisherman:
</p>
<p>
“I remember my husband used to go fishing with
you, Mr. Maynard. But he never brought fish into
the house where I could see them till they were
ready for the pan, so as not to shock me.”
</p>
<p>
“That was quite right of him, Mrs. Heard,” said
Mr. Maynard, gravely. Then he turned to Dot
again. “I hope you will all have a fine time on
your tour—you, especially, my dear. Do—do you
suppose you could spare a kiss for me—a good-bye
kiss?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, sir,” said the generous Dot. “And
I truly hope you won’t be sick again, Mr. Maynard.”
</p>
<p>
The man flushed deeply, saying:
</p>
<p>
“I have not been troubled by that sickness, my
dear, since the day you were so kind to me; and—please
God!—I never shall be again.”
</p>
<p>
He strode away then with a nod only to the
others.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—THE PASSING AUTOMOBILE</h2>
<p>
After the bustle of getting under way again
had quieted down and the car was speeding merrily
through the woodland and past the pleasant
farms of the Oxbow Valley, Agnes began to talk
eagerly to Neale O’Neil about the all-absorbing
topic which occupied her mind.
</p>
<p>
“How much do you suppose Mr. Maynard really
knows about the stealing of Mr. Collinger’s car?”
she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Not a thing!” said her boy friend, promptly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!”
</p>
<p>
“No. I know Mr. Maynard. He’s a perfectly
square man, I am sure. I don’t suppose he ever
noticed Saleratus Joe until I called his attention
to him.”
</p>
<p>
“Where do you suppose they have gone?” queried
the girl, starting on another tack.
</p>
<p>
“Who?”
</p>
<p>
“That Joe and the Brady man.”
</p>
<p>
“Ask me an easier one,” laughed Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“But can’t we do anything about it if we run
across them?” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“Joe and Brady?” gasped Neale, in wonder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
Neale eyed her quizzically for a long half minute—that
is, with one eye. The other he kept
faithfully on the road ahead.
</p>
<p>
“Aggie,” he said, “you beat the world. Mucilage
isn’t in it with you for sticking to a thing
when your mind is once set upon it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t care!” she pouted.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes you do. You evidently do care or you
wouldn’t be talking about that stolen car all the
time. What’s the odds where Mr. Brady and his
chauffeur have gone? You don’t suppose Brady
knows anything about Mr. Collinger’s machine
himself, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course he does! I believe he had it stolen,”
cried the girl.
</p>
<p>
“And if he did, so much the more reason for his
not knowing anything about what was done with
the car. That’s what Mr. Maynard intimated.
Brady would have no use for it. And I doubt if
anybody could use it long without being arrested.
Hard to hide an automobile nowadays. Unless
the thieves took it away up into Canada and sold
it, maybe.”
</p>
<p>
“Surely that Saleratus Joe couldn’t have done
that,” rejoined Agnes, instantly, “for he couldn’t
have gone there and got back so quickly.”
</p>
<p>
“Good girl. Female detective, I tell you!”
chortled Neale. “But how about the other fellow?”
</p>
<p>
“Who—that awful Brady?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“Cricky! No. They say there were two fellows
in Mr. Collinger’s car when it was driven
away from the court house. And maybe he—the
second chap—has the car now.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! I’d like to know,” sighed
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
This first day’s journey was rather long; the
smaller girls were tired by mid-afternoon. So
was Sammy Pinkney, although he would not admit
the fact. Tess and Dot went frankly to sleep
in the tonneau; Sammy kept himself awake by
asking questions of Agnes and Neale, so that they
could no longer discuss the stealing of Mr. Collinger’s
automobile, or any other subject of moment.
</p>
<p>
“If I ever go auto riding again with a kid of his
size,” growled Neale, at last, “I’ll insist on having
his question-asker extracted first.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! What’s a ‘question-asker,’ Neale?
Have I got one?” was the query that capped that
climax.
</p>
<p>
The effort to reach a certain old-fashioned hotel
on the road to Parmenter Lake, of which Mrs.
Heard knew, was successful. Without even a
minor mishap Neale brought the car to the Bristow
House an hour before sunset and in plenty of
time for supper.
</p>
<p>
As none of the four Corner House girls had ever
slept in a hotel before, this was a new experience
for them. Mrs. Heard engaged two double rooms
for herself and the girls, and a third for Neale and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
Sammy. Tom Jonah was made comfortable in
the stable yard.
</p>
<p>
The big dining-room was well filled when after
they had washed, they went down to supper. The
Bristow was popular despite the homely manner
in which it was managed.
</p>
<p>
“Good home cooking,” Mrs. Heard said, “and
simple ways. These girls who wait on us are all
from the neighboring families hereabout. It is
not a popular resort with the sporty class of
automobilists—although
I notice that occasionally one
of that kind gets in here.”
</p>
<p>
Her remark was to the point, for at that very
moment an example to prove the truth of it was
furnished by a big man sitting alone at a small
table at the end of the dining room.
</p>
<p>
“What?” he suddenly bellowed. “I can’t get
a drink here?”
</p>
<p>
“Tea, coffee, milk, or soft drinks,” the waitress
at that table recited, calmly. “The Bristow
House is temperance.”
</p>
<p>
The big man got up heavily, his face red, and
refused to eat. “That settles it!” he growled.
“I’d like to know what you keep a hotel for?”
</p>
<p>
“To feed people,” said the waitress, wearily.
She had evidently experienced a like incident before.
</p>
<p>
“That’s Jim Brady!” whispered Agnes, in excitement,
to Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
Neale sat near a window. When the politician
from Milton had stamped out, Neale peered around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
the window blind. The big French car was standing
before the hotel.
</p>
<p>
“But say! that isn’t the freckled-faced fellow
with him,” Agnes declared, peering around the
other side of the window frame.
</p>
<p>
“No. New chauffeur. There they go—aiming
for home. Guess he’s left Saleratus Joe somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d just like to know where,” sighed Agnes,
returning reluctantly to her supper.
</p>
<p>
By the time supper was over Sammy was again
nodding like one of those mechanical figures shop-keepers
sometimes put in their show windows to
attract attention. Neale had almost to carry him
up to the bedroom, and did have to help him undress
after he was there.
</p>
<p>
“Cricky!” ejaculated the flaxen-haired youth,
“I didn’t start out on this tour with the expectation
of nursing along a child, as well as an automobile.
I’m going to have a lot of fun myself if
I’ve got to play nursemaid for this kid.”
</p>
<p>
Neale was really good-natured, however, and,
for all his scolding, he helped Sammy off with his
clothing gently enough. As Ruth had threatened,
there was a bath made ready for Sammy, and that
rite had to be administered before the sleepy little
boy could creep between the sheets.
</p>
<p>
While Sammy was splashing in the bath a shout
of laughter from Neale brought Mrs. Heard and
the two older girls to the door of the boys’ bedroom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
“What <em>is</em> the matter, Neale O’Neil?” demanded
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Neale was sitting cross-legged on the floor,
rocking himself to and fro, and weak from laughter.
“Look what the kid’s brought with him in
his bag!” gasped the older boy. “I was looking
for his night clothes—and something clean for him
to put on in the morning. See the mess of stuff I
found, will you?”
</p>
<p>
It was a self-evident fact that Mrs. Pinkney,
Sammy’s mother, did not pack her little son’s suitcase.
</p>
<p>
Neale had hauled out first of all a tangle of fishing
tackle; a baking-powder box, well filled with a
supply of squirmy fish-worms, kept moist in black
soil that had sifted all over the contents of the
bag through the holes in the cover of the box
punched to give the worms air. There was Sammy’s
air-rifle in two sections and a plentiful supply
of ammunition; a banana reduced to pulp; a
bottle of matches; a sling-shot; a much-rusted
bread-knife with its edge patiently ground upon a
whetstone—evidently Sammy’s idea of a hunting-knife
or a bowie-knife.
</p>
<p>
In addition there was a very grubby-looking
pocket-handkerchief in which were tightly tied two
slimy garden snails; there was a piece of candy in
a soiled paper, with a buffalo nickel imbedded in
the confection; two brass wheels out of the works
of a clock; last Sunday’s lesson paper; two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
horse-chestnuts; and a pint flask with very suggestive
looking contents.
</p>
<p>
“What?” gasped Mrs. Heard. “That boy carrying
liquor?”
</p>
<p>
“And snails!” ejaculated Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Such a mess!” exclaimed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“But snails or the worms or anything else
there,” said the widow, severely, “will not steal
away men’s brains and make them ill. Where did
that boy get whisky—or is it brandy?” she added.
</p>
<p>
Neale had finally extracted the cork. He first
smelled and then tasted the suggestive looking
liquor. Mrs. Heard gasped in horror. Agnes
squealed. Ruth demanded:
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s what I thought!” said Neale. “Licorice
water. Wonder the flask didn’t break and drench
everything with the stuff. And he <em>has</em> brought a
few clothes.”
</p>
<p>
“I see very plainly,” Mrs. Heard said, when the
laughter had subsided, “that the first town we
come to of any size, we shall have to buy Sammy
some needfuls. Goodness! how ashamed his
mother will be when she learns of this.”
</p>
<p>
Sammy was too sleepy to be questioned at that
time about the wonderful contents of the suitcase;
but in the morning he confessed that after
his mother had packed the bag for him, he had
been obliged to take out “a lot of useless duds”
to make room for the necessary miscellany listed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
above which, to his boyish mind, was far more important.
</p>
<p>
However, it afforded the party a hearty laugh
and Mrs. Heard (who declared her nephew—the
now dignified county surveyor—had been just like
Sammy) cheerfully purchased a proper outfit for
the lad.
</p>
<p>
“I knew Sammy would be an awful nuisance,”
Ruth said.
</p>
<p>
“But, goodness! isn’t he funny?” giggled
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
The party made a good start from the Bristow
House about nine o’clock. They were to run that
day to Parmenter Lake, where they might spend
some time, and to one of the hotels at that resort
the trunks had been sent. They expected to have
their lunch again in the open, and the hamper had
been filled at the Bristow House.
</p>
<p>
Ever since the day the Corner House girls had
first met Mrs. Heard and her brown pony, Jonas,
there had been a matter puzzling Tess and Dot;
and as time passed and the curiosity of their two
active young minds was not satisfied, the children
had grown more and more insistent in their demands
on Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
They wished to know what it was Neale had
whispered into the fat brown pony’s ears when
the ex-circus lad had cured the stubborn creature’s
balkiness—for the time being, at least.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve always thought, Neale O’Neil, that you
were better than most boys,” Tess Kenway said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
seriously, the subject having come up again on
this morning’s run.
</p>
<p>
“And he never was so stingy before,” wailed
Dot.
</p>
<p>
“If he’d only tell me what he said to Jonas,”
Tess went on, “we could say it to Billy Bumps
when he balks. And you know he <em>does</em> balk
sometimes—most awfully.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tess! maybe the same words that started
the pony wouldn’t start a goat. Would they,
Neale?” asked the smallest Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
But Neale only grinned, and refused to be drawn
like a badger. The little girls could not get him
to talk at all about the mystery.
</p>
<p>
And right here, while they were miles from any
village—even while they were completely out of
sight of any dwelling—a most astonishing thing
happened.
</p>
<p>
Without previous warning the engine began to
cough, and the car ran more slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Now what’s happened, Neale?” inquired Mrs.
Heard, rather nervously.
</p>
<p>
Neale made no reply at all for a minute. He
tried first one lever and then another, ran slow,
tried to speed up, and then found that in spite of
everything he did, the engine was going dead.
</p>
<p>
He managed to get the automobile to the side
of the road out of the way of other traffic before
the engine entirely ceased to turn.
</p>
<p>
“Although there doesn’t seem to be much traffic
of any sort over this road,” said Ruth. “We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
haven’t been passed by an auto this morning.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say not!” exclaimed Agnes,
promptly. “Our car is no flivver, I’d have you
know. Do you expect, Ruth Kenway, to have all
the cars in Christendom pass us?”
</p>
<p>
“It looks now as though some of them might,”
responded the older girl, laughing at her sister’s
vehemence.
</p>
<p>
“I guess you’ve heard the story of the wealthy
man who went out driving in his high-powered
French car,” remarked Neale, who had tipped
back the hood and was looking to see if he could
find what was wrong, “and his chauffeur drove
too slowly to suit him.
</p>
<p>
“‘This is like a funeral procession,’ said the
owner to the chauffeur; ‘why don’t you drive
around that flivver in front of us?’
</p>
<p>
“‘No use, boss,’ the chauffeur told him.
</p>
<p>
“‘Why not?’ demanded the owner.
</p>
<p>
“‘There’ll be another flivver ahead of that.’”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right, Neale O’Neil,” put in Agnes,
smartly. “Trying to take our attention off the
fact that <em>we’re</em> not moving ahead very fast, either!
What’s the matter with it?”
</p>
<p>
“I—don’t—know,” confessed the boy.
</p>
<p>
He tried the starter and got a few feeble turns
out of the engine.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing doing,” he grunted.
</p>
<p>
“Is it something about the wiring?” murmured
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Can it be the carburetor?” asked Ruth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
“Maybe something is out of gear underneath
the car,” suggested Mrs. Heard, briskly. “Don’t
they always have to get under the car to repair
it?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes!” groaned Neale. “‘Get out and get
under.’ That’s the auto-driver’s motto.” He
pulled off his coat preparatory to doing exactly
what Mrs. Heard had suggested.
</p>
<p>
Tess observed gravely:
</p>
<p>
“Well! <em>this</em> isn’t something Neale can whisper
to and make go when it balks.”
</p>
<p>
To punctuate the laugh that followed this perfectly
serious statement on the part of Tess,
Agnes cried:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, listen! here comes another car.”
</p>
<p>
The rumble of an approaching automobile was
then heard by all, and it was coming over the same
road they had come. Before it appeared around
the nearest turn, they heard the warning “Honk!
Honk!” of its horn.
</p>
<p>
There whisked into sight the next moment the
rapidly-gliding automobile. Agnes was standing
up to look back. Almost instantly she uttered another
cry—this time almost a shriek:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!”
</p>
<p>
“Cricky!” was the boy’s gasped rejoinder.
</p>
<p>
For as the strange car flashed by they had both
recognized the man at the steering wheel as Joe
Dawson; and the appearance of the fellow beside
him was not a whit more confidence-breeding than
was Joe’s.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—AN ADVENTURE BEGINS</h2>
<p>
“That car was certainly not the stolen one,”
declared Neale O’Neil, after the automobile had
whizzed out of sight in a cloud of dust.
</p>
<p>
“No; it wasn’t a runabout,” admitted Agnes.
“But I just believe that man with Joe was the one
who helped him steal Mr. Collinger’s car.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you two talking about?” demanded
Ruth, for those in the tonneau had not recognized
Saleratus Joe.
</p>
<p>
“Did you want to stop those men to see if they
could help you, Neale?” asked Mrs. Heard. “It
will be awful if we have to stand here all day.
We’re still a long way from Parmenter Lake.”
</p>
<p>
Neale could not help uttering a grunt at that.
Nervous people are very nagging—without meaning
to be.
</p>
<p>
Just as he was getting down to crawl under the
machine Sammy Pinkney, who had been keeping
wonderfully quiet for him, suddenly asked:
</p>
<p>
“Say, Neale! You got any gas, do you
s’pose?”
</p>
<p>
Neale straightened up, looked at the little chap
who stood with his hands in his pockets and his
legs very wide apart, and finally exclaimed:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whether to be sore on you,
Sammy, or not!”
</p>
<p>
“Huh? What’s the matter?” asked Sammy,
belligerently.
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil started for the tank. “Why
didn’t you suggest that before?” he demanded.
“There! I declare, folks,” he added, “the tank’s
almost dry. I should have bought gasoline before
we left the hotel this morning.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, gracious, me!” cried Agnes. “It
can’t be so, Neale!”
</p>
<p>
“It’s empty,” the boy assured her.
</p>
<p>
“And we stuck on this lonely road!” gasped
Mrs. Heard. “No telling when another auto will
come by.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, Neale!” murmured Ruth, “how
could you be so careless?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s the easiest thing in the world to forget,”
the boy replied, with a quick grin.
</p>
<p>
“It was real smart of Sammy to remember
about the gosoling, I think,” said Dot.
</p>
<p>
“<em>‘Gasoline’</em>—little goose,” observed Tess, correcting
her smaller sister, as she often did.
</p>
<p>
Agnes laughed outright. “Well, gosling is a
little goose, sure enough, Dot.” Then she added:
“Now, Neale! what are you going to do?”
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil had opened the road guide and
thumbed several of its pages.
</p>
<p>
“Last place we passed where gasoline is for
sale, as I figure it, is twenty miles away.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” was the chorused groan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
“But here!” added the boy, with sudden enthusiasm,
“Procketts is but five miles ahead.”
</p>
<p>
“What is Procketts?” demanded Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Who</em> is Procketts?” added Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“A village. Gasoline is sold there,” declared
Neale O’Neil, confidently.
</p>
<p>
“But five miles!” cried Mrs. Heard. “Will
you have to walk there and bring back the gasoline
yourself? That is too bad!”
</p>
<p>
Neale smiled more broadly and returned the
book to his pocket.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll run along to Procketts and get our fill
of gas. It won’t take long,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“But, Neale!” Ruth began.
</p>
<p>
“How can we?” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Did you say the tank was empty, young man?”
demanded Mrs. Heard.
</p>
<p>
“Not a drop in it,” agreed the boy, answering
the chaperone’s question. “But—you see——”
and he bent over and manipulated a small cock,
“here’s the emergency tank. That’s always
filled, you know; and it will run us to Procketts, all
right.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you awful boy!” cried Agnes, half angrily.
“You let us think we were stuck here.”
</p>
<p>
“Cricky!” ejaculated Neale O’Neil. “Didn’t
you all just jump on me for being careless and
thoughtless? And none of you thought of the
emergency tank. A fellow’s got to protect himself
when he’s alone with a parcel of females,” and
he chuckled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
“You ain’t alone, Neale. I’m with you,” declared
Sammy Pinkney, suddenly.
</p>
<p>
The girls shouted with laughter; but Neale said,
preserving his gravity:
</p>
<p>
“Thanks, old chap. I guess we menfolk will
have to pull together in self-defence.”
</p>
<p>
They came to the next village in the course of
time, and Neale bought gasoline. Before one
o’clock they reached a delightfully wooded place
for camping, and proceeded to have lunch as they
had made it the previous day. They all declared
these rustic meals to be the best of all.
</p>
<p>
Just beyond the little grove was a pasture, and,
looking between the bars of the old stake and rider
fence, Tess and Dot saw that the open space
was studded with flowers of several kinds.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s pick some for Ruthie,” Tess suggested.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s. And for Mrs. Heard,” agreed Dot.
</p>
<p>
She ran back for the Alice-doll—for of course
that precious child had to pick flowers, too—and
to tell the older girls what they purposed doing.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard was taking a nap in the car, which
stood in the shade by the roadside; the older girls
were clearing up after the lunch. Neale and
Sammy had gone in the opposite direction, across
the road, where there was a pond and the promise
of a bath, and Tom Jonah had gone with them.
</p>
<p>
So nobody gave the little girls much attention
when they crept through the fence and out of sight
of the camping place.
</p>
<p>
Tess and Dot did not intend to go far. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
were plenty of flowers in sight of the place where
they entered the pasture.
</p>
<p>
But you know how it is. The patches of blossoms
at a distance appeared much more inviting
than those close to the fence. The little girls ran
from one to another patch, calling each other, delighted
to find such a wealth of lovely, brilliant
blossoms.
</p>
<p>
“I never <em>did</em> see such a lot of flowers in all my
life, Dot Kenway!” cried Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe this is the place where all the flowers
started from,” suggested the philosophical
younger sister.
</p>
<p>
“Where all the flowers started from?” repeated
Tess. “What do you mean, Dot Kenway?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, didn’t the flowers have to start <em>somewhere</em>—like
everything else? Our teacher says
everything has had a beginning—like the first
horses, and the first cow, and—and Adam and Eve,
I s’pose.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” said the less orthodox Tess, “who
told you there had to be a first flower, anyway?
Nonsense!”
</p>
<p>
“How did they come, then, if they didn’t spread—oh!
all around—from some place like this?”
demanded Dot, quite excited.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they just <em>came</em>,” declared Tess. “I suppose,”
she added, reverently, “that God just
<em>thought</em> flowers, and at once there were flowers—everywhere.”
</p>
<p>
Dot stood up, picking up the Alice-doll, and holding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
all the blossoms she could carry in her other
hand.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” she said, softly, looking out across the
field so spangled with the gay flowers, “He must
have thought <em>hard</em> about ’em when He made this
place, Tessie, for there’s so many.”
</p>
<p>
The next moment the smallest Corner House
girl forgot all her unfledged philosophy, for she
suddenly shrieked:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tess! Oh, Tess! Look at that <em>awful,
terrible bull</em>!”
</p>
<p>
Tess was so startled by her sister’s cry that she
jumped up, scattering the blossoms she had herself
gathered.
</p>
<p>
“Where? What bull?” she demanded, staring
all around save in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
“There!” moaned Dot, who was dreadfully
afraid of all bovine creatures, crushing both her
flowers and her Alice-doll to her bosom.
</p>
<p>
Tess finally saw what Dot had beheld. A great
head, with wide, dangerous looking horns, had appeared
above a clump of bushes not far away.
The animal was calmly chewing its cud; but the
very sidewise motion of its jaws seemed threatening
to the two smallest Corner House girls.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tess!” moaned Dot, again. “Will it eat
us?”
</p>
<p>
“Bulls—bulls don’t eat folks,” stammered Tess.
“They—they hook ’em. And how do you know it
<em>is</em> a bull, Dot Kenway?”
</p>
<p>
“Hasn’t it got <em>horns</em>?” gasped the smallest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
Corner House girl. “Of course it is a bull.
Come, Tess Kenway! I’m going to run.”
</p>
<p>
There seemed nothing else to do. Cow, or bull,
it mattered not which—both were comparatively
strange animals to the sisters. Most of the cattle
they had seen were dehorned.
</p>
<p>
They now scampered away as fast as they could
from the vicinity of the threatening peril. To
add wings to their flight the creature lowed after
them mournfully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I just <em>know</em> he wants to eat us,” gasped
Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Hook us, you mean,” corrected Tess, strictly
a purist even in her terror.
</p>
<p>
They scrambled on, panting. Tess tried to take
Dot’s hand; but the smaller girl would drop
neither the doll nor the flowers. Finally they
reached the fence at the edge of the woods, and
plunged through it. Thus defended from the
enemy (which had not followed them a step) the
little girls fell to the ground, breathless, but relieved.
</p>
<p>
“That nawful, nawful bull!” groaned Dot. “I
<em>did</em> think he’d get us before we reached the fence.
See Alice! She’s just as scared as she can be.”
And as the blue-eyed doll was a widely staring
creature, Dot’s statement seemed particularly apt.
</p>
<p>
“I lost all my flowers,” mourned Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there’s a lot more yonder,” said Dot,
pointing ahead. “Mine aren’t so good. I
squashed ’em, running so.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Tess suggested, recovering somewhat
from her fright, “let’s pick some more. That
old cow——”
</p>
<p>
“Bull!” interjected Dot, with confidence.
</p>
<p>
“Well, bull, then. He needn’t think he’s going
to scare us so we can’t carry a bouquet to Ruthie
and Mrs. Heard.”
</p>
<p>
“No-o,” agreed Dot, rather doubtfully. “But
I don’t want to go back through that fence again,
and into that field.”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t have to,” declared Tess, promptly.
She was standing up now and could see farther
than Dot. “There’s another open place where
there’re flowers—and there isn’t any fence.”
</p>
<p>
“And no bulls?” queried Dot.
</p>
<p>
“There <em>can’t</em> be,” Tess assured her. “They always
fence up cattle. We shouldn’t have gone
through that fence in the first place.”
</p>
<p>
So, having somewhat recovered from their
panic, they pursued their adventure without for a
moment considering that the farther they went in
this direction, the greater the distance back to the
place where their friends and the automobile remained.
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Agnes did not think anything about
the absence of the two smaller girls until Neale,
Sammy and the dog returned from their baths.
</p>
<p>
As Neale O’Neil came along from the pond and
into sight of the automobile and the girls, he was
laughing heartily, while Sammy’s face was very
red.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Neale?” demanded Agnes,
suspecting a joke.
</p>
<p>
“This kid’ll be the death of me, girls,” declared
Neale, still chuckling. “I took along a piece of
soap with the towels and told Sammy to see if he
couldn’t get some of the dust and grime off his
face and hands. Cricky! I never knew a kid
could get so much dirt on him between breakfast
and noontime.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he looks clean now,” said Ruth, kindly,
seeing that Sammy was not very happy because
of Neale’s fun.
</p>
<p>
“I guess he is,” Neale chuckled. “I said to
him, ‘Sammy, did you scrub your hands good?’
And he said, ‘Sure!’ ‘And wash your face?’
‘Yep,’ he answered. And then I remembered the
part of his anatomy that a kid usually forgets is
hitched to him. ‘How about your ears?’ I asked
him. And what do you s’pose he said?”
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t even guess,” giggled Agnes.
“What?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Sammy said: ‘I washed the one that’s
next to Aggie when I’m sitting in the car. You
needn’t tell her ‘bout the other one,’” and Neale
O’Neil burst into laughter again—as did all the
others, save Sammy himself.
</p>
<p>
It was Sammy trying to turn the current of
conversation from his ears, who discovered the
continued absence of the two little girls.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Tess and Dot?” he inquired.
</p>
<p>
“Picking flowers,” said Agnes, promptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
“But, goodness!” added Ruth, “they have
been picking them a long time. Ever since you
boys went for your swim. They must have gathered
a bushel.”
</p>
<p>
“Go call ’em, Sammy,” said Mrs. Heard. “We
want to start now, I suppose. It’s a long way to
Parmenter Lake yet, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
Neale pulled out the much-thumbed guide.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s see,” he said, fluttering the pages.
“There’s where we are—sixteen—no, seventeen
miles beyond Procketts—where we bought the gasoline.
That pond we just went to—Oh! that’s
Silver Lake. I bet it used to be called ‘the mud-hole’
before the day of automobile road guides.
</p>
<p>
“Just beyond, along this road, is what the guide-book
calls ‘a mountain tarn.’ What’s <em>that</em>, do
you suppose?”
</p>
<p>
“A swamp,” declared Ruth, promptly and
wrongly.
</p>
<p>
“It’s right near a village called Frog Hollow.
Oh! ‘Recently renamed Arbutusville.’ What do
you know about <em>that</em>?” chuckled Neale, delighted.
“And a piece beyond there’s a precipice, ‘from
the verge of which can be seen the ever-changing
view of the entire eastern end of the Oxbow.’
Cricky! I bet the view isn’t half as changing as
the names of these rural frog-ponds and the like.
And I bet the precipice is a stone quarry,” he
added, with conviction.
</p>
<p>
“I expect that ‘wayside inn’ they speak of,”
said Agnes, who was looking over his shoulder, “is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
nothing but one of those squalid old beer-shops we
see along the road.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” commented Mrs. Heard, with a sniff,
“it must take more imagination to get up one of
those road guides for automobilists than it does to
find all the virtues in a Presidential candidate.”
</p>
<p>
Just then Sammy came plunging through the
bushes. “Say!” he cried, “I can’t find ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Sammy!” said Agnes. “Why didn’t
you call Tess and Dot?”
</p>
<p>
“Did,” he declared. “Been hollering my head
off.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that funny?” commented Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whether it is funny or not,” Mrs.
Heard said, briskly. “Those children should be
found.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. We’re ready to start,” said Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Surely they would not have gone far,” Ruth
added, in a worried tone.
</p>
<p>
Silence fell. The older members of the touring
party looked at each other with growing apprehension.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—SEEKING</h2>
<p>
“Why, of course, the children are all right,”
Neale said, briskly. “Hold on! I’ll make them
hear.”
</p>
<p>
He punched the lever of the horn several times
and the clarion “Honk! Honk!” echoed through
the grove.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mercy!” ejaculated Mrs. Heard, with her
hands over her ears. “That should wake the
dead.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, let’s see if it wakes up Tess and Dot,”
laughed Neale O’Neil. “Come on, Aggie, let you
and me run and find them.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t get lost yourselves,” Ruth called after
them, laughing now.
</p>
<p>
After being startled for the moment by Sammy’s
report, all of them felt it was really impossible
that Tess and Dot should be lost.
</p>
<p>
Neale and Agnes, with Tom Jonah in pursuit,
ran over the slight rise out of sight, hand in hand
and laughing, like the children they were themselves.
They came to the fence and looked
through it.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, that’s where they are,” Agnes
said. “Do look at the flowers, Neale.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
</p>
<p>
“They must have gone on down the hill,” the
boy agreed, and he and Agnes crept through the
fence, on the trail of Tess and Dot.
</p>
<p>
They saw no trace of the children at first. And
the mild-eyed cow that had caused all the trouble
had disappeared. After a while Agnes cried out:
“Oh, Neale! They picked flowers here. See the
broken stalks!”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” he agreed. “Let’s shout for them.”
</p>
<p>
Again and again they shouted the little girls’
names—singly and in unison.
</p>
<p>
“Where <em>could</em> they have gone—not to hear us?”
demanded Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t suppose they are playing ’possum, do
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale—never!”
</p>
<p>
“But there’s no place for them to go. You can
see all over this pasture. Here, Tom Jonah!
Find them! Find Tess and Dot!”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t see behind all the clumps of bushes,”
suggested Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“But, cricky! are they asleep behind the bushes
somewhere?” Neale demanded.
</p>
<p>
“No-o. Not likely,” Agnes admitted.
</p>
<p>
“But—here!” shouted Neale. “What’s this?”
</p>
<p>
He had found the place where Tess, frightened,
as was Dot, by the cow, had stood up and dropped
her great bunch of picked flowers. “What do you
know about that?” the boy asked, quite seriously.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! Their flowers. They would never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
have thrown them away unless something had happened.”
</p>
<p>
“But what?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t imagine,” said Agnes, almost in tears.
</p>
<p>
“Neither can I,” growled the boy, staring
around the field. “Now, don’t turn on the
sprinkler, Aggie. Chirk up. Of course, nothing
really <em>bad</em> has happened to them.”
</p>
<p>
“Why hasn’t there?” choked Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Well, how could there? Right here almost in
sight of the road. You girls would have heard
them if they had cried out——”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think they’ve been carried off—stolen—kidnapped?
Oh, Neale O’Neil! do you?” almost
shrieked Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, stop it, you little goose—stop it,” begged
the boy. “Of course not.”
</p>
<p>
“Goose yourself——”
</p>
<p>
“No; gander,” said Neale O’Neil, determined
now not to let Agnes see how serious he felt
the disappearance of Tess and Dot was. “Now,
Aggie, you stay here while I run around a bit and
see what I can find.”
</p>
<p>
He started off, Tom Jonah going too. The hot
sun had almost immediately destroyed any scent
the children may have left as they passed; and although
the old dog understood very well what the
matter was—that his two little mistresses had disappeared—he
could find the trail no better than
could Neale and Agnes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
Neale ran, shouting, toward the far end of the
pasture. Almost at once he and the barking dog
started something.
</p>
<p>
With a puffing snort, and a great crackling of
brush, up rose the peaceful cow that had so
startled Tess and Dot Kenway.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! come back!” shrieked Agnes, as she
saw the wondering cow looking over the bush at
her.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” the boy demanded, while
Tom Jonah approached the cow curiously.
</p>
<p>
“The cow!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she won’t hurt you,” declared Neale
O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“Just the same I’m afraid of her,” said Agnes.
“See her now!”
</p>
<p>
The cow was shaking her horns at the dog, and
threatening him.
</p>
<p>
“Like enough she has a calf hidden away there
in the brush,” said Neale. “And——Cricky!”
suddenly he added; “I bet she scared the kids.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!”
</p>
<p>
“Sure! That’s what’s the matter. They saw
her and ran. And they ran in the wrong direction,
of course,” Neale continued, with very good
judgment.
</p>
<p>
“Do you really think so, Neale?”
</p>
<p>
“Just as likely as not. Come here, Tom Jonah!
She’ll hook you yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” said Agnes, quickly, “then we should be
able to find the poor little things easily.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“Huh? How do you make that out?” Neale demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Why, if they ran in the wrong direction, we
ought to follow them.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right,” returned the boy. “But
there are so many wrong directions! Which did
they take?”
</p>
<p>
Agnes began to sob. Neale could not comfort
her. Tom Jonah came and lapped her hands with
his soft tongue, to show that he, too, sympathized
with her.
</p>
<p>
The boy shouted until he was hoarse; but no
childish cry was returned to him on the soft breeze.
</p>
<p>
And there was very good reason for that. The
two smallest Corner House girls had some time
since wandered beyond the sound of Neale’s voice
or the dog’s bark,—even beyond the sound of the
automobile horn.
</p>
<p>
While the older folk were seeking Tess and
Dot, the two young explorers were seeking their
friends. At first one could not have convinced the
children that they were lost. No, indeed! It was
Ruth and Agnes and Neale and Tom Jonah and
Mrs. Heard and Sammy—and even the automobile—that
had lost themselves.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see where they could have gone to,”
complained Dot, tired at last of carrying both the
Alice-doll and her flowers so far.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t s’pose we’d come so far from that
road,” agreed Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I see it!” Dot cried, suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
“The auto?”
</p>
<p>
“No, no! The road.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” said Tess, gladly. “Then we’ll find
them now.”
</p>
<p>
The little girls climbed down a bank into a road
which—had they known it—would have taken them
out into the more important highway the motorcar
was on. But unfortunately Tess and Dot
turned in the wrong direction. They kept on
walking away from their friends.
</p>
<p>
Had they not done this, or had they sat down
and waited, Neale O’Neil and Tom Jonah would
have found them in time; for they searched the
patch of woods clear to this back road before returning,
hopelessly, to the automobile to report
their failure.
</p>
<p>
However, Tess and Dot walked and walked, until
they really could walk no farther without resting.
And then, having been absent from their
friends for fully three hours, they had to sit
down.
</p>
<p>
Dot cried a bit and Tess put her arms about her
and tried to comfort the smallest Corner House
girl. They had both long since thrown their
flowers away, for the blossoms had wilted.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, Dot,” Tess said, trying to be very
brave, “Ruthie and Aggie and the rest can’t be
far away.”
</p>
<p>
“But why did they go off and leave us behind?”
wailed the little girl. “And—and—I
<em>ache</em>!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where do you ache, dear?” asked the sympathetic
Tess.
</p>
<p>
“In—in that funny bone that goes up and down
my back,” sobbed Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Funny-bone! Why, Dot!” cried Tess, “that
isn’t in your back. Your funny-bone is in your elbow.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess I know where I hurt, Tess Kenway!”
responded Dot, indignantly. “And it isn’t in my
elbow. It’s that long, straight bone in my back
I’m talking about. You know, Tess—your head
sits on one end of it and you sit on the other. And
it’s all—just—one—big—ache——So there!” and
she cried again.
</p>
<p>
“Now, I tell you what, Dot Kenway,” said Tess,
briskly. “There’s one thing never does any good—not
when your folks is lost from you.”
</p>
<p>
“Wha—what’s that?” choked the smallest
Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Crying,” the older sister said, firmly.
</p>
<p>
“We—ell,” sniffed Dot.
</p>
<p>
“So let’s not do it. We can rest here as long
as you want. When your backbone stops aching,
we can go on.”
</p>
<p>
“But where’ll we go to?” was Dot’s very pertinent
query.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why, we’ll just walk on—along the
road.”
</p>
<p>
“And where does <em>it</em> go to?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, does that matter?” returned Tess,
bravely. “Of course our automobile will come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
along and pick us up. Or, if it doesn’t, we’ll reach
a house and the lady will invite us in.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” whimpered Dot, “I don’t care how soon
we reach that house—and the lady ‘vites us in—and
gives us our supper. I’m hungry, Tess.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you s’pose <em>I</em> am, too?” asked the older
girl, with some asperity. Dot <em>did</em> sound rather
selfish. “And Alice?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! the poor, dear child must be just starved,”
sniffed Dot, hugging the doll closer.
</p>
<p>
“But she isn’t complaining all the time,” said
Tess, scornfully.
</p>
<p>
Dot fought back her tears. “I think you’re
horrid, cruel, cross, Tess Kenway!” she said.
“But I’ll try not to cry.”
</p>
<p>
There was reason for the children’s hunger. It
was now after six o’clock, the sun had disappeared
behind the woods, and they had walked a long
way.
</p>
<p>
Once they heard a great crashing in the bushes.
</p>
<p>
“Bears! bears!” whispered the excitable Dot.
</p>
<p>
“No-o,” Tess said, gravely. “It didn’t say
anything about there being bears in this neighborhood,
in that book of Neale’s. If there were
bears, he’d have told us about them.”
</p>
<p>
“Well—well——whales, maybe.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, Dot! you are the tryingest child!
Whales live in the sea.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t they ever come out?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” declared Tess, with conviction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not even to rest themselves?” demanded Dot,
with wonder. “I should think they would get
awful tired swimming all the time. It must be
more tireful than walking,” and she sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Tire-some,” corrected Tess, but without enthusiasm,
and thinking of the whales. “Perhaps
they come into shallow water and lie down on the
bottom of the sea with their heads sticking out to
breathe. Yes, that must be it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” sighed Dot, for at least the twentieth
time, and with lapsing interest in the whale.
“Oh, dear! I wish Tom Jonah were with us.”
</p>
<p>
“So do I! So do I!” agreed Tess, for as dusk
came on she, like the smallest Corner House girl,
was becoming truly frightened.
</p>
<p>
The disturbance in the bushes was repeated, and
the children tried to run. A loud bell jangled—a
most annoying bell; and in the distance a voice
sounded:
</p>
<p>
“So, boss! So, boss! So, boss!”
</p>
<p>
It only frightened Tess and Dot the more to
hear such strange sounds. They had never before
heard the cows called home. And, besides, after
their recent experience, they would have been only
the more disturbed had they been aware that the
thrashing in the bushes was Sukey, getting ready
to go up to the bars to be milked.
</p>
<p>
No house did they see, however; not even a barn.
They were on a back road, very seldom traveled,
and the farms, what few there were in the neighborhood,
faced on other highways.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
The children trudged on, hand in hand, both
crying now. Tess was weeping softly; but
Dot was crying aloud, not caring who heard
her.
</p>
<p>
When they came to a field beside the road, Tess
stared all about for a light. But there was no
beckoning lamp in a farmhouse window; nor even
a flickering lantern to point the way to the farm
outbuildings.
</p>
<p>
The streak of violet, shading to light blue, that
evening had painted along the horizon with her
careless brush, disappeared. Tall, black figures
of trees upreared themselves between the children
and the sky, and seemed to stalk nearer, threateningly.
</p>
<p>
A great nightbird floated out of the wood and
swept low across the field with a “swish, swish,
swish” of powerful wings. When it rose into the
trees again it said:
</p>
<p>
“Who? Who-o? Who-o-o?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Who <em>is</em> he?” gasped Dot, clinging close
to her sister.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Owl,” said Tess, promptly. “You <em>know</em>
you’ve heard about owls, Dot Kenway!”
</p>
<p>
“But—but I didn’t know they could <em>talk</em>,”
breathed the smallest Corner House girl, with a
sigh. “Tessie, I can’t walk any farther,” she
suddenly announced. “It isn’t only that funny
bone in my back; but my ankles are breaking right
off—so now!”
</p>
<p>
“But—but there isn’t any good place for us to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
stop till our automobile comes along,” hesitated
Tess.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care, Tess Kenway! <em>I’ve got to
stop!</em>”
</p>
<p>
That settled it. At the edge of the dark wood
the two little girls crept up on a grassy bank, between
two roots of a great tree, sheltered at the
back by a thick brush clump, and there they sat,
clinging to each other’s hand.
</p>
<p>
They were too frightened to talk. Too alarmed
even to weep any more.
</p>
<p>
Around them, when they were still, scurried the
little creatures of the night—the field mice, and
the moles, perhaps, and the baby rabbits, and other
small animals who shiver—as Dot did—when the
great owl swoops low, crying his eternal question:
</p>
<p>
“Who? Who-o? Who-o-o shall I take for supper?”
</p>
<p>
The small fry of the fields and woods tremble at
that cry more than did the two lost Corner House
girls.
</p>
<p>
There may have been other enemies of the helpless,
furry little animals lurking near, too—the
weasel, the polecat, the ferret; even a red fox
might have wandered that way and joined the
bright-eyed company that kept watch and ward
over two sleepy, sobbing children.
</p>
<p>
But nothing harmful was near them and, finally,
Tess and Dot Kenway slept as sweetly and as
soundly as though they were in their own beds in
the old Corner House in Milton.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—THE GREEN AND ORANGE PETTICOAT</h2>
<p>
Ruth and Agnes Kenway were in tears. Once
before—when the Corner House girls were at
Pleasant Cove—the two smaller sisters had been
lost, and on that occasion circumstances seemed to
blame Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Now neither of the older girls was to blame for
the absence of Tess and Dot. Mrs. Heard said so.
But both Ruth and Agnes felt condemned.
</p>
<p>
After searching the pasture and the patch of
woodland beyond it, clear to the back road, Neale,
disappointed, was inclined to scold Tom Jonah
for not picking up the trail of the lost children.
</p>
<p>
Tom Jonah, however, was not a hunting dog;
his nose was not as keen as some breeds possess—especially
now that he was old. But he showed
almost as much anxiety as his human friends on
this occasion.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t scold him, Neale,” begged Agnes, sobbing.
“He’d find Tess and Dot if he could—poor
old fellow. See! he knows what I am saying.”
</p>
<p>
The dog whined and lay down, panting. Indeed,
it did seem as though there was nothing more
to do here. The children, whether they had wandered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
away or had been carried off, certainly were
not in the vicinity.
</p>
<p>
“Two hours have been wasted,” said Mrs.
Heard; “although we did not know we were wasting
them, of course. We had to do what we could
toward finding the children near by. But now we
must waste no more hours. We must get help.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! what help?” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“We must run to the next town—Frog
Hollow,” said Neale, in an undertone“—and
get the constable or sheriff or <em>somebody</em>. We
must start a crowd with lanterns to beat the
woods. Maybe somebody has seen the children.
They may be safe already in somebody’s house.”
</p>
<p>
“Or in the police station,” put in Sammy Pinkney.
“I got lost once and that’s where they found
me. Of course, I was a kid then. The cops was
real good to me. One of ’em bought me ten cents
worth of butter-scotch—you know, that awful,
sticky, pully candy, Neale. And when my father
come I couldn’t holler to him ’cause my teeth was
all stuck up.”
</p>
<p>
“I bet that cop gave you the candy on purpose
to shut your mouth,” growled Neale. “You were
talking them to death, it is probable.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, me!” cried Agnes, “don’t let us just
talk; let’s do something.”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Heard is quite right, I can see,” Ruth observed,
recovered now in a measure from her first
panic. “We must ask the authorities to help us.
I should have been more careful.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, Ruth,” said the chaperone, “don’t blame
yourself. How could you have foreseen this?”
</p>
<p>
“I should not have allowed them out of my
sight without Tom Jonah with them,” the oldest
Corner House girl declared. “Nor will I again
on this trip, you may be sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on, now,” growled Neale, who felt very
much disturbed about the loss of the little girls
but who, boy like, did not wish to show his feelings.
“Come on, now; we’ve talked enough.
Let’s do something. Get in here, Tom Jonah—you
useless old thing! You’re not half a dog or
you’d have been able to follow ’em.”
</p>
<p>
The big Newfoundland, with drooping flag and
sheepish look, scrambled into the front of the
car. So did Sammy. The automobile started
and they sped away toward Frog Hollow, or Arbutusville,
each revolution of the wheels taking
them farther and farther from the lost children,
sleeping under the great tree at the edge of the distant
wood lot.
</p>
<p>
The automobile party were to spend a very anxious
night—much more so than Tess and Dot
Kenway, who had sobbed themselves to sleep
among the huge tree-roots. Their sylvan couch
was soft; the night was warm; and not a thing
disturbed them after their eyes were shut.
</p>
<p>
A fretful bird, crying in the dusk of early dawn,
aroused Dot for a moment; but she found Tess beside
her, so went off to sleep again without realizing
that she was not in her own bed at home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
Dawn soon smeared her pink finger-prints along
the gray horizon. Other birds sleepily awoke.
The morning breeze rustled the leaves, which took
up their eternal gossip again just where it had
ceased when the night wind died.
</p>
<p>
One morning call after another resounded
through the forest patch. The light grew stronger
and the tiny, furry things crept away to bed. The
owl had long since ceased his querulous call. A
feathered martinet that had at intervals, all the
night long, declared for the castigation of “poor
Will,” pitched for a last time upon a dead limb
at the edge of the wood and shouted forty-three
times in succession: “Whip-poor-will!” without
awakening Tess and Dot Kenway.
</p>
<p>
They slept on as day broke and the World
yawned and threw off the coverlet of night to hop
out of bed. The first red ray of the sun finally
slanted over the tree-tops and struck right into
the face and eyes of the smallest Corner House
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! I don’t like that sun,” complained
Dot. “Mo—move over, Tess Kenway.”
</p>
<p>
Tess’ eyes popped open and she was immediately
wide awake, while Dot was still snuggling
down and trying to go to sleep again.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Dot Kenway!” exclaimed the older girl,
“do you know what we’ve done?”
</p>
<p>
“No-o,” mumbled Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Why! we’ve slept all through the night.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw—ri’,” Dot said, with very little interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“And do you know where we are?” pursued the
lively Tess.
</p>
<p>
“I—I——Oh! is it time to get up?” yawned
Dot.
</p>
<p>
Then she opened her eyes, too, and saw what
Tess saw—the curve of the shaded road stretching
away into the wood. The two little girls had
been well sheltered under the thick umbrella of
the tree; but in the open the grass blades sparkled
with dew.
</p>
<p>
Birds hopped about, hunting their breakfasts—big,
fat robins in their red vests; a chattering
jay that flirted his topknot knowingly as he peered
at the two Corner House girls; a clape, running
spirals around a neighboring tree trunk like a
little striped mouse, and looking at the children
with interest. Across a broken wall a red squirrel
ran—that pirate of his tribe. A rabbit
started suddenly from his form in the grass, and,
with a resounding thump or two, shot off across
the field as though hearing a sudden call to breakfast
at his house. The stirring of the little girls
stirred everything else here to sudden activity.
</p>
<p>
“Why, dear me, Tess Kenway,” gasped Dot,
“we—we didn’t get home, did we?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess we didn’t,” cried Tess, getting up
quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! nor we didn’t find the automobile,” added
Dot, the memory of what had happened returning
quickly. “Why, Tess! we’re lost.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess we are,” admitted her sister.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
“I thought Ruth and Agnes and the others were
lost; but I guess it’s us, after all, who don’t know
where we are.”
</p>
<p>
“Wha—what’ll we do?” asked Dot, yawning
again, and scarcely alert enough yet to appreciate
the serious side of the situation.
</p>
<p>
“Well! we needn’t be afraid of anything now
that it’s daylight. Come along, Dot—let’s find a
brook,” said the practical Tess. “I want to wash
my face.”
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t any towels,” objected Dot, trotting
along the road beside her sister. “Nor any
soap, Tess.”
</p>
<p>
“Why! what do you suppose the squirrels and
the rabbits and all the other woodsy things do for
towels and soap?” demanded Tess, briskly. “I
guess water’s <em>clean</em>; it’ll wash you.”
</p>
<p>
“And our teeth-brushes, Tess?”
</p>
<p>
Tess overcame even that seemingly insurmountable
difficulty. After they had found the
brook—a quiet brown pool beside the road—and
had bathed their faces and hands, Tess broke a
twig and chewed the end to a brush-like swab, and
so brushed her teeth thoroughly. Dot followed
her example, and laughed.
</p>
<p>
“We are two wild girls,” she declared. “We
haven’t any home—nor anything. That is, for a
little while,” she added, rather doubtful as to how
this new game would “pan out.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, when our clothes wear out we’ll have
to make new ones. And for Alice, too.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
“How?” asked Tess, in turn curious. “What
out of?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’ll weave new dresses out of grass and
leaves, and trim them with flowers,” declared the
smallest girl, gaily.
</p>
<p>
“Well, so we could,” agreed Tess, catching fire
from her sister’s enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
“Of course. And shoes——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know!” Tess cried. “We’d find
rushes beside the pond and weave basket-work
sandals to wear ‘stead of shoes. And we might
weave hats—like the Chinese do. And we’d build
ourselves a house, and thatch it all over to keep
the rain out—”
</p>
<p>
Dot had suddenly grown silent and allowed Tess
to do all the talking. Tess looked at the smallest
Corner House girl quickly. Dot’s lips were
puckered into a pout and her dark eyes were filling
rapidly.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter now, dear?” Tess asked,
tenderly.
</p>
<p>
“Do—don’t let’s talk about it any more,”
choked Dot. “Besides, I’m hungry.”
</p>
<p>
Tragedy stalked into the situation right then
and there. They had no more imagination to
waste upon the supposed life of a “wild girl.”
The principal question was: How were two little
girls, fast becoming “wild,” to eat?
</p>
<p>
They were walking along the road again when
Tess suddenly spied something which brought a
cry of delight from her lips.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
“Look! Look, Dot!” she said. “What’s on
those bushes?”
</p>
<p>
The bushes in question overhung the bank above
their heads.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dot! aren’t those blueberries?” the older
girl added.
</p>
<p>
“Of course they are, Tess Kenway,” agreed
her sister. “My, I could eat just bushels of ’em.”
</p>
<p>
They scrambled up the bank and climbed the
wall. Not only was there this clump of berry
bushes which they had first sighted; but back of
the wall was a great field, rocky and barren otherwise,
but a fine berry pasture.
</p>
<p>
Farther out where the sun shone, the berries
were larger and more had ripened. The little
girls went on and on, picking the berries in handfuls
and actually cramming them into their
mouths. They were very hungry.
</p>
<p>
Their fingers and lips became stained; and if
the truth were told some of the crushed berries
left stains upon their mussed frocks as well as
upon their faces. They reached the farther end
of the field before they realized that they were
so far from the road.
</p>
<p>
Tess was about to suggest that they go back.
Somebody might come by on the lonely road they
had been following. And then she saw the orange
and green petticoat fluttering in the bushes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dot! what’s that, do you suppose?” Tess
whispered, seizing her sister quickly by the hand.
</p>
<p>
“Oh-ee! A bear?” returned Dot, without even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
seeing the gay garment beyond the brush clump.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! A bear <em>that</em> color?” demanded
Tess, with some exasperation.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the wearer of the gay garment stood
up. She was a very brown woman, with great
hoops of gold in her ears, and she wore other gay
garments besides the green and orange petticoat.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” murmured Tess, again, “I—I believe
she must be a Gypsy woman, Dot Kenway.”
</p>
<p>
Had the two little Corner House girls not been
so much excited at just this minute they must
have heard the passing of an automobile on the
road, now out of their sight. Or, if Neale O’Neil
had chanced to blow the horn just then Tess and
Dot would surely have been attracted by the
sound.
</p>
<p>
To the older Corner House girls and to Mrs.
Heard that night had certainly been one of extreme
anxiety. Neale had found lodgings for
them in the squalid little village which the post-office
authorities recognized as “Arbutusville,”
but which was still “Frog Holler” in the minds
of the older inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
Neale found, too, a number of kind-hearted persons
who were easily interested in the fate of Tess
and Dot Kenway. There was a constable, and
with that official at their head a dozen men started
abroad at nine o’clock, with lanterns and a pack
of “’coon dogs,” to beat up the woods all about
the place where the automobilists had camped.
</p>
<p>
Neale went with them; but despite Agnes’ determination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
to attend she was refused the privilege.
And Sammy, of course, remained with the
women—they needing the protection of some
manly spirit—and fell asleep in two minutes.
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil dragged back about dawn. The
search had been resultless—save that the dogs had
started a raccoon—and the party had swept
woods, fields, and swamps for miles as well as it
could be done at night. They had shouted. They
had roused every householder. Nobody had
heard of the lost children or seen them.
</p>
<p>
But Neale had heard one thing that greatly
troubled him; and yet which offered a possible
clue to the little girls’ disappearance.
</p>
<p>
On the way back to the village somebody in the
crowd of searchers had told him that one of the
aroused householders had mentioned the fact that
there was a Gypsy encampment not many miles
away.
</p>
<p>
The boy was instantly excited. He learned
from his informant just where the camp was, and
immediately put the idea before the constable.
</p>
<p>
“Why, that’s too fur away, bub,” said Constable
Munro. “It’s five mile beyond where you
an’ your folks stopped to eat—and on another
road.”
</p>
<p>
“The children might not have walked all that
way,” said Neale O’Neil. “They might have
been carried there.”
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh? Against their will?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, why not?” returned Neale. “We hear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
all kind of stories about Gypsies. I’ve seen some
bad ones myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, they’re petty thieves, and bad horse traders
sometimes. But to steal a couple of kids—I
dunno ’bout that. Still—if you air bound to
go there——”
</p>
<p>
“I am,” Neale declared. “I’ll have the machine
ready as soon as I get a bite of breakfast.”
</p>
<p>
He was sorry to have no good report to make
to the girls and Mrs. Heard, and could only tell
them, while he ate his hasty breakfast, where he
was going and what he hoped to accomplish.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going with you,” announced Agnes and
Sammy in a breath.
</p>
<p>
“No,” he said to the girl. “You can’t go. The
constable won’t like it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t see——”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure you would not like to go with a
party of rough men,” said Mrs. Heard, with such
finality that Agnes became quiet.
</p>
<p>
But that did not stop Sammy’s teasing. “Say,
us men ought to go, anyway,” he said. “Come
on! Lemme go, Neale. I won’t be in the way.
Tom Jonah’s going.”
</p>
<p>
So in the car that had passed so near the two
little lost girls as they picked berries, were Neale
and Sammy, as well as Tom Jonah and the constable,
Mr. Munro. Tess and Dot were too
greatly interested just then, however, in that
vivid petticoat and in the strange looking woman
who wore it to think about anything else.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—WITH THE ROMANY FOLK</h2>
<p>
The woman had a very brown face and wore
great hoops of gold in her ears, while on her head
was a sort of turban with a fringed end hanging
down behind. She certainly was dressed in very
gay colors.
</p>
<p>
She had bright, beady black eyes, and when
she saw Tess and Dot Kenway she looked at them
very kindly indeed. At least, her smile was
broad and her voice, when she spoke, was pleasant.
She carried a heaping basket of berries.
</p>
<p>
“You leetle children out early to pick the berry,
eh?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am,” said Tess, gravely.
</p>
<p>
But Dot was more communicative. She said
promptly: “We’ve been out all night.”
</p>
<p>
“Picking berries?” queried the woman. “Not
alone, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“We only just found the berries,” declared
Dot, the chatterbox. “And, oh! we <em>were</em> so hungry.”
</p>
<p>
“You are out all night?” asked the puzzled
woman. “Is it so?”
</p>
<p>
“We—we got lost from our folks,” Tess said,
at last.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p>
“You leeve near here, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” said Tess, now more communicative,
“We live in Milton. We were riding in an
automobile——”
</p>
<p>
“No, we weren’t!” interposed Dot, rather impolite
in her eagerness to get the story perfectly
straight. “We were stopping for lunch. Right
beside the road. And Tess and I came to pick
flowers.”
</p>
<p>
“So you wandered from your friends?” asked
the Gypsy. “I see. I see.”
</p>
<p>
“And,” added Dot, confidently, “we’re hungry.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dot!” exclaimed the scandalized Tess.
“Not <em>now</em>! Not after eating all these berries!”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! what’s berries?” demanded the smallest
Corner House girl. “I want an egg—and
milk—and hot muffins—and——”
</p>
<p>
The Gypsy woman laughed merrily. Although
she did not speak English quite like other people,
she seemed to understand the language well
enough.
</p>
<p>
“You leetle ‘Merican girls come wit’ me,” she
said. “I will find you food. Then we will find
your friends.”
</p>
<p>
Tess was a little doubtful of their new acquaintance.
She had some fear of Gypsies as a
tribe. This one seemed kind enough, and looked
kind enough. Nevertheless, Tess felt that they
should be careful while in her company.
</p>
<div><a name='illus3' id='illus3'></a></div>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<span class='caption'>“You leetle ‘Merican girls come wit’ me.”</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>
But she could not explain this to Dot, and Dot
was a prattler. The smaller girl’s tongue went
as fast as a mill-clapper, as Aunt Sarah Maltby
often said; and it was particularly energetic this
morning as she trotted along beside the Gypsy
woman in the green and orange petticoat.
</p>
<p>
“Ah,” said the woman, at last, “your people
are reech, eh? They have one of these motor
cars, and you leeve in a fine, big house? They
will give reward, then, to get you back, eh?”
</p>
<p>
Just then, before either Tess or Dot could make
a rejoinder, they broke through the bushes and
entered a beautiful little park in which was
pitched the Gypsy camp.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the two smallest Corner House girls
had often heard of Gypsies. Indeed, they had
seen more than a few of them. The women often
came into Milton to sell basket-work and to tell
fortunes.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the summer before, when the Corner
House girls and Neale O’Neil were at Pleasant
Cove, they had had quite an experience with Gypsies—and
not a very pleasant experience at that.
Tess remembered this, though Dot did not; therefore
the older sister was a little troubled as they
approached the Gypsy encampment with the gaily
dressed woman.
</p>
<p>
This opening in the woods, with a grassy road
running through its center, which was plainly no
main-traveled highway, was a lovely spot. The
Gypsies are thorough exponents of the out-of-door
life, now so much talked about; and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
have, too, some idea of the beautiful and picturesque.
</p>
<p>
This encampment had been selected because of
the pleasant little brook running near, and the
real beauty of the spot. There were six big covered
wagons, all brightly painted. Besides, four
tents were set up, and there were coops of
chickens and other signs that the encampment
was more or less permanent.
</p>
<p>
On the appearance of the two strange little girls
with the Gypsy woman, there was a rush of dogs,
chickens, goats, pigs and children toward the newcomers.
Tess and Dot clung together and tried to
get behind the green and orange petticoat. The
woman shouted something in a strange tongue,
and drove the children and dogs back. The other
curious riff-raff of the camp had to be actually
kicked out of the path.
</p>
<p>
There were several cooking fires in the camp, a
number of men and women in sight, and at least
fifty horses grazing at one end of the park,
watched by several half-grown youths. Plainly
there was a big tribe of the Romany folk encamped
in this spot.
</p>
<p>
The woman with the gay petticoat, having given
up her basket of berries to a girl, led the visitors
by the hand, one on either side, to the nearest
fire, where a big man in brown velveteen garments,
including a peaked cap, and wearing gold
hoops in his ears and a heavy gold chain around
his neck, was sitting in a green-painted easy chair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
This man was a person of much importance,
it was evident. Nobody else came near him as
the woman approached with the two little Corner
House girls.
</p>
<p>
He was not a bad looking man at all, though
his face was deeply graven in lines, and wind and
weather had tanned his face and hands like
leather. Again in that strange language which
Tess and Dot did not know, the woman spoke to
this man, who was certainly the leader of the Gypsies.
</p>
<p>
The man’s eyes twinkled at the children, and
he smiled. But he did not win their confidence.
However, he shouted for another woman almost
at once, and she came from the fire with two plates
of steaming hot stew—either of rabbits or squirrels,
Tess did not know which. And neither she
nor Dot cared.
</p>
<p>
They were, indeed, very hungry. A diet of
blueberries is not a filling one—especially when
one has been without anything else to eat for so
long as had the little Corner House girls. The
woman with whom they had come into the camp
sat down with them, having reported to the big
man, and ate, too. They sat cross-legged on the
grass, and had only spoons to eat with, and thick
slices of very good ryebread to sop up the gravy
of the stew. The woman said her name was
Mira, and the children found her very pleasant
and talkative.
</p>
<p>
“I wish our folks would come along in the automobile,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
Tess said, longingly, when their hunger
was partly appeased.
</p>
<p>
“Do you s’pose they <em>will</em> come this way?”
asked Dot of Mira.
</p>
<p>
“We shall see. <em>He</em> will ’tend to that,” said the
woman, coolly, nodding towards the big man in
the chair.
</p>
<p>
Tess was very curious. “Who <em>is</em> he?” she
asked, in a whisper. “Who is the man in the
chair?”
</p>
<p>
“King David,” said Mira.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Dot. “I’ve heard of him.
Didn’t he play on a salt-cellar?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” cried Tess. “A ‘psalter,’ Dot—a
‘psalter’!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what’s the difference?” asked the smallest
Corner House girl, pouting.
</p>
<p>
“A good deal,” declared Tess, although she
had no idea herself just what a psaltery was, and
was unaware that she had made a mistake quite
as inexcusable as Dot’s. “And, anyway,” pursued
Tess, whose confidence swamped her ignorance
of the subject and duly impressed Dot,
“anyway, this can’t be the same King David.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said the woman. “He is King David
Stanley. We are English Gypsies.”
</p>
<p>
“But—but you and he didn’t talk English?”
Tess suggested, hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>
“Among ourselves we talk Egyptian,” said the
woman, proudly. So she called the language of
the Gypsies. “We are all Romany folk.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
Of course, the children did not understand
much about this. But Dot was anxious upon one
point, and she whispered to Tess:
</p>
<p>
“How can that big man be a king? He doesn’t
wear a crown. Don’t all kings wear ’em? I
never saw a picture of a king without one on his
head—though I should think ’twould make ’em
bald.”
</p>
<p>
“Sh!” whispered back Tess. “Maybe they
aren’t comfortable to wear.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! where’s his scalper?”
</p>
<p>
“His <em>what</em>?” gasped Tess.
</p>
<p>
“His scalper,” declared Dot. “Kings always
carry ’em in their hands.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, for mercy’s sake!” ejaculated Tess. “A
sceptre, you mean.”
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t they what kings scalp folks with?”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, Dot Kenway!” said Tess, in despair.
“Kings aren’t like Indians. They don’t
scalp folks.”
</p>
<p>
“But they order their heads cut off if they don’t
please ’em,” said Dot, unconvinced, and eyeing
King David askance.
</p>
<p>
The Gypsies were, however, all very kind to the
visitors. Mira would not allow the wild and
scantily dressed children of the camp to annoy
the little Corner House girls. And she always
drove the dogs away when they came too near, for
Dot was frankly afraid of the hungry looking
beasts.
</p>
<p>
But Mira brought a clothes-basket out of one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
of the tents, and covered in that were six little
blind, black puppies, “too cute for anything,” as
Dot admitted. There were kittens, too, and a
hutch of little chickens, and some tame rabbits.
When the visiting children were shown two little
kids—twins—gamboling around the mother goat,
their delight knew no bounds.
</p>
<p>
These interests held their attention for much
of the forenoon—especially Dot’s. But Tess began
to wonder if something would not soon be
done about finding the automobile and their
friends. She grew more anxious as noon approached
and nothing was said about this mystery.
</p>
<p>
The King of the Gypsies had disappeared some
time before. Mira was busy. And Dot, in spite
of a lapful of kittens, began to ask her sister:
</p>
<p>
“Tess, when are we going to find Ruth and Aggie?
I—I don’t want to stay here much longer,
do you?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—ANOTHER CLUE</h2>
<p>
Neale O’Neil’s early morning visit to the Gypsy
camp had been very disappointing. The camp
had been fully aroused, and there were plenty of
children about; but none of these were Tess and
Dot.
</p>
<p>
“But say!” Sammy Pinkney whispered to Neale
in an awestruck voice, “you know how the Gypsies
do when they steal kids, don’t you? They stain
’em with walnut juice and you can’t tell ’em then
from their own kids.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess we should know Tess and Dot, if
they were stained as black as Petunia Blossom’s
pickaninnies,” snorted Neale. “The little girls
aren’t in this bunch, for sure!”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the constable had shown his star to
King David Stanley and explained the errand
they were here upon. The chief Gypsy vigorously
denied having seen the lost children—as indeed
he had not at that time—but he promised to
look for them and have the tribe look in that vicinity
immediately after breakfast.
</p>
<p>
“And if we find them you shall learn of it at
once, young sir,” the big Gypsy assured Neale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
“I will myself bring you word at the village where
you are stopping.”
</p>
<p>
He spoke very good English, did the king, and
seemed to be really sympathetic. But Neale
O’Neil turned the automobile about, and with anxious
heart drove back to Arbutusville.
</p>
<p>
They made him go to bed, once he arrived at the
lodging where the older girls and Mrs. Heard were
staying. Neale was completely worn out, and
even Agnes refrained from letting him see how
troubled and distraught they all were because of
his non-success in finding Tess and Dot. Therefore,
Neale was sound asleep when a man wearing
brown velveteen and with gold rings in his ears
rattled into town in a ramshackle old buggy, but
behind a high-stepping horse. It was King David
Stanley, and he hunted out Constable Munro at
once and told him that the two lost children had
been found and had been brought into the Gypsy
camp.
</p>
<p>
Not being entirely sure that Tess and Dot were
the two in which the automobile party were interested,
the chief of the Romany tribe had judged it
better to bring the news rather than the children.
</p>
<p>
“You know how our people are sometimes
looked upon by the Gentiles,” he said gravely.
“If I had taken the little girls away from the camp,
and their friends had appeared there, asking for
them, my act in removing them would look suspicious.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re an all-right feller, if ye be a Gyp.,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
declared Mr. Munro, and he took King David over
to the lodging where the automobile party was
staying.
</p>
<p>
By this time the girls and Mrs. Heard were in
the lowest depths of despair. Ruth was even seriously
discussing sending a telegram to Mr. Howbridge.
</p>
<p>
“Though what he could do more than we are
doing ourselves, I don’t see,” Mrs. Heard sighed.
</p>
<p>
“We are not doing anything!” cried Agnes, beginning
to cry again. “I believe if they’d have
let me go with them into the woods last night, I
could have found poor, precious little Dot and
Tessie. What <em>shall</em> we do——”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go with you, too, Aggie,” declared Sammy,
having hard work to keep back the tears himself.
“I bet you and I can find ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“It is the easiest thing in the world to be a
critic,” Ruth said quietly. “But we should first
know how better to do a thing before finding fault
with the person who has done it. I think——”
</p>
<p>
And just then Constable Munro and the big
Gypsy appeared in their sitting-room, and immediately
their despair was changed to joy. Neale
came stumbling out of the bedroom, rubbing the
sleep out of his eyes, and led the cheering. For
a few moments the automobile tourists certainly
were quite beside themselves.
</p>
<p>
Nothing would do but all must run out to the
encampment to get the lost little girls. And although
King David started before them, the motor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
car passed him and his swift pacer on the road
and arrived at the Gypsy encampment a good fifteen
minutes before he appeared.
</p>
<p>
Tess and Dot, by this time, had become rather
lachrymose. They dared not ask Mira again about
their lost friends; and even the lapful of kittens
palled at last on Dot. With the coming of the automobile,
however, all this was changed. At once
both Tess and Dot could see nothing but good in
their friends, the Gypsies. Ruth and Agnes, with
Sammy, had to be led all about the encampment,
to see the pets and to learn how the Gypsies lived
in their wagons and tents, and otherwise to be
shown the wonders of the place. Mrs. Heard and
Ruth ransacked their purses for pennies to distribute
to the bare-legged children attached to the
camp.
</p>
<p>
“And <em>we</em> were wild girls, too—for a little
while,” said Dot. “Weren’t we, Tess?”
</p>
<p>
“Too bad you were so wild that I didn’t find you
when I was over this way early this morning,”
grumbled Neale O’Neil. “Anyway, if I hadn’t insisted
on coming we wouldn’t have found the kids
yet.”
</p>
<p>
“My! aren’t you smart?” scoffed Agnes, who
felt happy enough to bicker with him now.
“Well! somebody, I suppose, must blow a horn
for you—why not yourself?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t make a practice of parading my
virtues,” began Neale, when Agnes stopped him
with:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
“I should say you didn’t, Neale O’Neil. Let
me tell you it takes quite a number to make a
<em>parade</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Got me there! Got me there!” admitted the
boy, grinning. He did not mind the tartness of
his girl chum’s tongue, now that the little ones
were found. Everybody was joyful over the reunion.
</p>
<p>
The king of the Gypsies had been examining the
automobile most curiously during this time.
</p>
<p>
“Fine car,” he said to Neale. “I’m thinking
some of getting one myself. Only trouble is, sure
to frighten the horses, and if we didn’t have horses
to trade they wouldn’t believe we were Gypsies,”
and he smiled with a wonderful flash of strong,
white teeth.
</p>
<p>
Neale laughed. “I suppose pretty soon all up-to-date
Gypsies will go about the country in auto-vans
instead of those green and yellow painted
wagons,” he suggested.
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe,” said the man. “We had a couple of
men here one night not long ago with a car. They
came from Milton. At least, I heard one of them
say so.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes was beside Neale. Suddenly she seized
his arm and squeezed it tightly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” she gasped.
</p>
<p>
The boy had noted the significance of King David’s
speech too. He nodded to the girl and asked
the big Gypsy at the same time:
</p>
<p>
“What sort of car did those fellows have?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it was a small car. A runabout—Maybrouke
make. Good car, but not like this.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Collinger’s runabout,” whispered Agnes.
“That was his make.”
</p>
<p>
“When were these fellows here?” asked Neale.
Then he explained: “We’re very much interested.
One of our friends lost a car like the one
you describe. Can you remember just when it
was?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, young sir. It is fixed in my memory,”
and the Gypsy mentioned a date immediately following
the day on which the car of the county
surveyor had been taken away from the Milton
court house.
</p>
<p>
“It was those men!” cried Agnes decidedly.
</p>
<p>
King David looked at her curiously. “They
tried to sell the car to me,” he said. “I was not
sure they came by it honestly. So many people
try to foist stolen goods on us because we are
Gypsies.”
</p>
<p>
This was a new light on that subject; yet Neale
O’Neil thought it might be quite true. “Give a
dog a bad name and hang him” is not only a trite
saying, but a true one.
</p>
<p>
“What did the fellows look like?” he asked the
chief, and quickly described in particular the fellow
they knew as Saleratus Joe.
</p>
<p>
“No mistaking him, young sir,” said the chief
Gypsy. “He was one. The other was an older
man.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know him so well,” admitted Neale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
“But I am sure it is lucky you did not buy the
car. There would have been trouble. Do you
know where they went from here?”
</p>
<p>
“No. They remained over night with us because
a storm came up. I sheltered the car in
one of our tents. But about a week ago I saw
them and the car again,” he added.
</p>
<p>
“No!” cried Neale, in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I drove over into what they call the Fixville
district—it’s beyond Parmenter Lake—to
look at a horse. There is a big farm over there
that isn’t being worked this year—owned by a
man named Higgins. They’re only getting the
hay off it. You see, last winter the house burned
to the ground and Mr. Higgins, who is an old man,
was badly burned and isn’t able yet to take up his
work again. He is with friends somewhere.
Well,” went on the Gypsy, “the outbuildings and
barns were saved. As I drove by the place I saw
this freckled chap and that other backing the car
into one of the big hay barns. It was just at nightfall.
Of course, I don’t know that they stayed
there more than one night.”
</p>
<p>
Neale and Agnes were greatly excited by this
story. It seemed as though it were the clearest
clue yet discovered regarding the stealing of Mr.
Collinger’s runabout. From the Gypsy Neale obtained
a very clear and particular account of the
place where the suspected men and car had last
been seen, and how to get there.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll just go around that way after we leave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
the hotel at Parmenter Lake,” declared Agnes.
“Why! maybe we’ll find the car right there.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s too late for <em>May</em> bees,” grinned Neale.
“This is July.”
</p>
<p>
But he had some little hope of tracing the lost
car himself, in spite of his fun. However, as Mrs.
Heard declared with decision, first of all the party
would run on to the hotel at Parmenter Lake where
they had rooms and their trunks awaiting them,
and there recuperate.
</p>
<p>
“So much excitement is not good for me, I declare,”
said the lady. “I feel it in my legs.”
</p>
<p>
That puzzled Dot Kenway immensely. Yet she
was too polite to ask Mrs. Heard how it could be.
Nevertheless, she whispered to Tess:
</p>
<p>
“How do you suppose she could feel <em>our</em> being
lost in <em>her</em> legs? We did the walking.”
</p>
<p>
Tess failed to give a satisfactory reply.
</p>
<p>
They arrived not long after mid-afternoon at the
resort on Parmenter Lake, which was, indeed, a
very popular inland summer place. Mrs. Heard
felt the need of quietness, and Ruth spent most of
her time watching the children; but Agnes felt no
necessity for “recuperation.”
</p>
<p>
She had a delightful time the two days and evenings
they spent at the hotel. There was a dance
each night, and she danced more than she ever had
before in her life in forty-eight successive hours.
</p>
<p>
There were so many young people of about her
age at the hotel and in neighboring cottages, that
Agnes was sure to have her fill of enjoyment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
Neale, meanwhile, overhauled the motor car and
made all shipshape for their continued tour.
</p>
<p>
Tess and Dot lived in a sort of Land of Romance
because of their recent adventure. They were
much sought after by other little girls because they
had been lost, had stayed in the woods all night,
and had joined (if for only a brief time) a band
of Gypsies.
</p>
<p>
Master Sammy was tipped out of a boat on the
lake and came near drowning. Then he led a
newly formed crew of “fresh water pirates” in a
raid on an orchard and was caught and well
spanked by the owner. He certainly was a trial;
but he was growing strong and healthy looking.
This outing was doing Sammy Pinkney a world
of good, whether the older members of the touring
party benefited or not.
</p>
<p>
When they finally left the Parmenter Lake hotel
the motor car was in fine fettle and so were all the
young people in it. And Mrs. Heard declared that
her nerves had recovered from the shock they had
suffered when Tess and Dot were lost.
</p>
<p>
Agnes and Neale, one may be sure, had not forgotten
what King David Stanley had told them
about Saleratus Joe and the missing runabout.
They had heard nothing further about the stolen
car, although both had asked.
</p>
<p>
Neale had looked up the roads in the guide book
and they now sped directly over the nearest route
for the abandoned farm where Joe and the car
had last been observed by the Gypsy chief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard was quite as eager as Agnes and
Neale to learn if trace of her nephew’s car could
be found in this neighborhood. She had written
one letter to Mr. Collinger regarding their suspicions
of Joe Dawson and his appearance with a
runabout in this part of the State.
</p>
<p>
They ran on beyond the end of the lake and
thence into a much more scantily populated country
than that through which they had previously
traveled.
</p>
<p>
They struck into the road at last on which King
David had said the site of the burned farmhouse
was. Not another dwelling was on this cross highway,
and the road map gave its length as twelve
miles.
</p>
<p>
Save for the cleared acres of the Higgins farm,
on both sides thick woods bordered the road. Of
course, they could not mistake the farm itself
when they came to it. The fire had left nothing of
the great house but the cellar walls.
</p>
<p>
However, there were several good outbuildings,
especially the hay barns. The Gypsy had told
Neale clearly into which of the two barns he had
seen the men running the automobile.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to have a squint, anyway,” said
Neale, stopping the car and promptly getting out.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful,” urged Mrs. Heard. “Don’t get
into trouble,” though how he could do that in this
forsaken place it was not easy to guess.
</p>
<p>
There was not a soul around the place as far as
the touring party could see.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—SEARCHING THE BARN</h2>
<p>
“I’m going too! I’m going too!” exclaimed
Sammy Pinkney, scrambling out of the car after
Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
Agnes was opening the door on her side of the
car, but Neale said quietly:
</p>
<p>
“Now, wait a little, both of you. Aggie, you’d
spoil everything. And, Sammy, you keep still,”
and he tossed that offended youngster back into
the front seat.
</p>
<p>
“Aw, say!” bristled Sammy.
</p>
<p>
“You’re so bossy, Neale O’Neil,” declared
Agnes. “I’d like to know——”
</p>
<p>
“See here,” interrupted the youth, with his
back to the burned house and the barns, “if there
<em>should</em> be anybody on watch, it wouldn’t do to let
’em see we’d come here just for the sake of looking
into that hay barn.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” observed Agnes, sitting down again.
</p>
<p>
Neale had opened the hood and made a pretense
of fumbling inside.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” he said, still in a low voice, “I want
it to appear that something has happened to our
car. Now I’m going to hunt in the tool kit——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
“Whuffor?” demanded Sammy. “I’ll find it
for you.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll sit where you are,” declared Neale
O’Neil sternly. “I’m supposed to be hunting for
something I can’t find. Then I’ll go up to that
old barn and try to find it. It won’t look right if
everybody gets out of the car and goes snooping
around.”
</p>
<p>
“I admire your language, Neale O’Neil,” sighed
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Do go ahead and see what you can find, boy,”
urged Mrs. Heard, very much excited now.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” murmured Agnes. “He acts as
though he expected to find that barn full of robbers.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothin’ but rats in it, I bet,” grumbled
Sammy, feeling much abused.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, there! You don’t catch <em>me</em> going near it,
then!” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Neale, undisturbed by either Ruth’s criticism or
Agnes’ fun-making, proceeded to act as though the
motor car had really met with an accident.
Finally he started for the barn, which stood some
distance back from the road.
</p>
<p>
“Look out for the rats—oh, <em>do</em> look out for the
rats, Neale!” Tess called after him.
</p>
<p>
“He can’t whisper to the <em>rats</em>, anyway,” remarked
Dot. “I guess Neale O’Neil, even if he
did come from a circus, can’t tame <em>all</em> animals.”
</p>
<p>
The approach to the barn was by a broad, well
graveled drive which sloped smoothly upward to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
the wide barn door. Almost at once Neale O’Neil
saw that there had been an automobile on this
piece of gravel. He could see where the wheels
had skidded and disturbed much of the surface of
the drive—whether when the car entered the barn
or when it came out, he could not say.
</p>
<p>
He looked sharply around on all sides, but saw
nobody. By the strands of twisted hay hanging
from the closed loft door he presumed the upper
part of the barn was filled with the only crop being
harvested on the Higgins farm this year. On
trying the main door, Neale found it barred; but
there was a small door beside the great one, and
this opened at his touch upon the latch.
</p>
<p>
The great barn was filled with a brown dusk in
which Neale O’Neil could see nothing at first. But
by stepping within and leaving the door open, he
was able to obtain some idea of what was on the
barn floor. On either side were the mows, the hay
stacked in them down to the ground. The loosely
boarded loft over the runway of the barn had also
been filled, he supposed. The sweet, dusty odor
of the cured grasses was almost overpowering at
first. Dim outlines of a few old agricultural tools
were to be seen in the gloom. These were shoved
back out of the way so as to clear the middle of
the course.
</p>
<p>
Neale, still curious, fumbled at the bar which
held closed the two-leaved door, and finally opened
this. The door swung open slowly and the strong
July sunlight rushed in. Millions of motes danced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
in the sunshine that spread across the barn floor.
Now all was revealed.
</p>
<p>
“Can you find it?” cried Agnes from the seat
of the automobile.
</p>
<p>
Neale had to wag his head in negation. There
was nothing here that looked like a motor car.
Back, at the rear of the barn floor, the hay had
overflowed the mows and loft, and was heaped in
a fragrant pile on the barn floor to the height of
the floor of the loft.
</p>
<p>
“One sure thing, they’ve got an abundant hay
crop stored away,” thought Neale O’Neil. “Uncle
Bill Sorber’s elephants would find plenty of
fodder here.”
</p>
<p>
He laughed, barring the big doors again securely.
As he came out of the barn he glanced
sharply around, but saw nobody save his own
friends in the motor car.
</p>
<p>
Naturally his examination of the other farm
buildings was hasty; but he neglected to look into
no shed large enough to have housed the runabout
of which he was so eagerly in search. He came
back to the Corner House automobile with the assurance
that there was no car but their own at the
Higgins farm, and made the statement boldly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, but,” pouted Agnes, shaking her head
at him, “I’d feel much more satisfied if you had
let me look.”
</p>
<p>
“Me, too,” grumbled Sammy. “I bet I could
see into smaller places than <em>you</em> could, Neale
O’Neil.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
Neale just grinned at them. “This isn’t a flivver
we are looking for, I’d have you know. The
Maybrouke is some car, believe me! You folks
talk like the funny-man who went into the flivver
factory to look around; and when he came out he
kept scratching himself—said he was sure he had
got one of the things on him!”
</p>
<p>
There was no use of waiting around on this
lonely road any longer, so Neale got in and started
the car again. As they had got off their original
route some distance in coming to this farm, it
would be impossible to make a good hotel that
night.
</p>
<p>
“But,” as Mrs. Heard said, “we have nothing
to fear after that lodging in Frog Hollow——”
</p>
<p>
“Arbutusville, Mrs. Heard—do!” laughed
Agnes, in correction.
</p>
<p>
“Well. That woman had the hardest beds I
ever saw. If the street pavements had been as
hard they would certainly have had good roads
in that town.”
</p>
<p>
They stopped at a countryside store for lunch
and bought crackers and cheese and milk, and
feasted while sitting in the automobile under the
shade of a great elm.
</p>
<p>
“We’re almost like Gypsies ourselves,” said
Tess, ruminating as she crunched the crackers and
cheese. “Aren’t we, Dot?”
</p>
<p>
“No. We’re cleaner,” said the smallest Corner
House girl; “and we haven’t any little goaties—<em>and</em>
pigs! But this is lots of fun, just the same;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
and I wish we <em>could</em> sleep out again all night—just
for once—all of us, of course.”
</p>
<p>
She came near having her wish that very night,
or so it seemed when sunset came. In some way
they got off the marked route they had been following,
and, on stopping at a crossroads to ask
a blacksmith who was just closing his shop, they
found that they were far away from the beaten
track of automobile tourists.
</p>
<p>
“We might have known that,” grumbled Ruth,
“from the state of the roads.”
</p>
<p>
“The worst of it is,” said Mrs. Heard, a little
worried, “it is going to be hard on the children.
They are tired out now. And it is a dark
night.”
</p>
<p>
“No moon till late—that’s a fac’, ma’am,” said
the blacksmith, leaning on the mud-guard while
Neale lit the lamps.
</p>
<p>
“And have we got to go back over that rocky
piece of road to get to the Tailtown Pike?” asked
Agnes, trying to study out the lost route in the
guide book.
</p>
<p>
“It’s forty-five miles to Tailtown, where we
were going to stop. And over the meanest roads
in the State, I bet,” growled Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me!” sighed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“There are <em>some</em> objections to touring the country
roads in an automobile,” admitted Mrs. Heard.
“And things seemed to be going so smoothly!”
</p>
<p>
“I dunno what you’ll do,” drawled the blacksmith.
“’Nless you talk to mother.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
</p>
<p>
“To <em>whom</em>?” chorused the older girls and the
chaperone.
</p>
<p>
“Mother. Mebbe she kin advise ye,” drawled
the man. “We live down the road jest a piece. I
dunno what she’d say——”
</p>
<p>
“Does she know the roads better than you do?”
asked Neale bluntly.
</p>
<p>
The blacksmith laughed mellowly. “I don’t
reckon she does—’cept the road to Heaven, son,”
he said. “She sure knows all about <em>that</em>. But
she might be helpful. I’ve been takin’ her advice,
off and on, for forty years, and whenever I’ve took
it I’ve not been sorry.”
</p>
<p>
“Come!” exclaimed Ruth suddenly, “let us
drive on to this gentleman’s house.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is it?” asked Neale, getting in behind
the steering wheel again.
</p>
<p>
“You can see our kitchen lamp twinkling in the
window yonder,” said the blacksmith, stepping
upon the running-board as Neale started the car.
</p>
<p>
They jolted down the rough road, and quickly
came to the house in question. As far as they
could see, it was rather a large country house with
a terraced lawn before it and a driveway running
up beside the dwelling to the rear premises.
</p>
<p>
“Drive her right up to the door, young man,”
advised the blacksmith.
</p>
<p>
“Room to turn around up there?” asked Neale,
the careful.
</p>
<p>
“Plenty,” agreed the man. “Don’t have no
fear about that.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
Neale immediately turned the car up the little
incline and the blacksmith leaped to the ground
as it stopped.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” he said jovially, “one of you young
misses just go up there on the porch and tell
mother how you’re fixed. You can git out, ma’am,
I’m sure,” he added, to Mrs. Heard, as Ruth
jumped from the car. “Get out your baggage
too—this here little shaver can help at that,”
and he rumpled Sammy’s hair with his big
hand.
</p>
<p>
“But—but——Do you mean we can stay
here?” gasped Mrs. Heard.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had scarcely reached the door when it was
opened from within. A comfortable figure of a
woman, with spectacles and gray hair, faced the
oldest Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well!” said “Mother,” in just the hearty
tone of voice a mother should possess. “An automobile
party? Well, well! how many of you air
there, my dear?”
</p>
<p>
“But, my goodness me!” gasped Ruth.
“You’re not going to take us in ‘sight unseen,’ in
this way, are you?”
</p>
<p>
The woman laughed. “Why not?” she asked.
“If you are going to do anything for anybody, it
ain’t perlite to hem and haw about it, I’m sure.
Leastways, that’s the way <em>I</em> was brought up, my
dear. And there’s little children with you, too!
Of course you shall stay.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth and the others were speechless. Such hospitality—and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
evidently this was not a house of
public entertainment—was quite unexpected.
</p>
<p>
“That you, Buckley?” she called to her husband.
“You see to putting up the car. How many did
you say there was? I want to know how much
ham to slice,” and she chuckled unctuously again.
</p>
<p>
“There’s seven of ’em, Mother,” called the
blacksmith’s mellow voice from the dark, “<em>and</em> a
dog. B’sides, mebbe you’d better take notice that
two of ’em’s boys, and like enough they’ve got
their appetites with ’em,” and he broke into another
mellow guffaw.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Agnes later whispered to Ruth, “this
is certainly the unexpected end of a perfect day!
Goodness! what should we have done if these good
people hadn’t taken us in? The blacksmith says
they are rebuilding the bridge over Mason’s Creek
and we couldn’t have got across.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
“And that would have made us go around so
far that the run to Tailtown would have been
nearer sixty miles than forty-five.”
</p>
<p>
They were all glad; and such a supper of ham
and eggs as they ate! The accommodations the
blacksmith’s wife put at the party’s disposal were
ample too.
</p>
<p>
“Just the same,” yawned Neale, before retiring,
“this has sure been an empty day. There hasn’t
been much doing.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you expect to happen in these
perfectly civilized places?” responded Agnes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
“And we have surely had enough excitement to
last us for a while—the children getting lost, and
all,” Ruth said.
</p>
<p>
“And you hunted for that car of Mr. Collinger’s,”
said Agnes, slyly. “<em>That</em> was exciting,
I’m sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh—ouch!” yawned Neale. “Don’t knock,
Aggie. We may find that car—and Saleratus Joe—yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Your desire for low company shocks me,
Neale,” giggled Agnes. “Saleratus Joe, indeed!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say a word,” the boy retorted. “You
and Ruth met the gentleman first—don’t forget
that,” and they separated for the night with
laughter.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER</h2>
<p>
Things began to happen, however, bright and
early the next morning. “The kids,” as Neale
called the two smaller Corner House girls and
Sammy Pinkney, were out of their beds betimes,
and out of doors as soon as they were dressed.
The blacksmith’s house was an old-fashioned place,
and there were many things interesting to the little
folks about it. Besides, if there had not been
a thing in sight, the three juveniles would have dug
up something interesting in a very short time.
</p>
<p>
The blacksmith was already off to start his
smithy fire in the shop at the fork of the roads.
“Mother,” with the help of a neighbor’s daughter
called in for this emergency, was hurrying about
the kitchen and dining room preparing the huge
breakfast she thought necessary for these unexpected
guests.
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil came out, yawning as he had gone
to bed, and opened the door of the shed in which
the automobile had been lodged in lieu of a proper
garage. Neale always looked over the car before
they started the day’s run, as all careful chauffeurs
should.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
The children ran for the automobile, of course,
before Neale could back it out of the shed; and as
Tess and Dot and Sammy jumped on the steps to
ride out, a white hen flew from the tonneau with
a wild squawk.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, for goodness’ sake!” cried Tess. “What
do you s’pose that hen was doing there?”
</p>
<p>
The hen had flown to the top rail of the calf pen,
and there proceeded to “cut, cut, cu-da-cut!” just
as loud as she could.
</p>
<p>
“Aw, what are you squalling about?” Sammy
demanded. “Nobody hurt you.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe she wants to go to ride with us in our
automobile,” said Dot demurely.
</p>
<p>
When the automobile was backed out upon the
gravel it was Tess who looked into the tonneau and
spied the reason for Mrs. White Hen’s loud remarks.
There it lay, white and warm, upon the
rear seat.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! Goodness me!” gasped Tess, with
clasped hands. “Isn’t that cunning? She laid an
egg right here for us, Dot.”
</p>
<p>
“My,” Dot observed, “maybe she thought she
could pay for a ride with us.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess she must know something about the
way gas has gone up,” chuckled Neale O’Neil,
“and she wanted to pay for her share.”
</p>
<p>
They had to secure that egg at once and run to
ask “mother” if they could have it. Though, as
Dot Kenway declared:
</p>
<p>
“It’s the most mysteriousest thing why that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
blacksmith calls her ‘mother’ when she isn’t, but
she’s his wife.”
</p>
<p>
However, that “mysteriousest thing” was not
on the carpet just then. It was the egg found in
the automobile that was in question, and the blacksmith’s
wife said:
</p>
<p>
“Yes, of course you shall have it. Them
dratted hens lay everywhere. I guess they’d lay
in the parson’s hat.”
</p>
<p>
“Oo-oo! not if he had it on,” murmured Dot.
</p>
<p>
Then immediately, there was another subject of
discussion. What should they do with the fresh-laid
egg?
</p>
<p>
“Eat it, of course,” said Sammy.
</p>
<p>
“It won’t go far—one egg—among three such
savage appetites as you kids possess,” Neale declared.
</p>
<p>
“Why—no,” murmured Tess. “You couldn’t
very well divide an egg in three parts.”
</p>
<p>
“Not till it’s cooked,” Sammy put in, promptly.
“Let’s have it fried.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I like eggs soft-boiled,” Dot exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Why! then we can’t divide it even after it’s
cooked,” cried Tess; “for I like my eggs hard-boiled.”
</p>
<p>
“It can’t be done, then,” said Neale O’Neil,
solemnly, but vastly amused. “You can’t first
boil an egg hard, and then soft, and then fry it.”
</p>
<p>
“She—she ought to have laid three eggs,”
growled Sammy.
</p>
<p>
“You should speak to her about that,” Neale returned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
Then he added, as a suggestion: “Why
don’t you cast lots for it?”
</p>
<p>
“Cast lots for <em>what</em>, Neale O’Neil!” demanded
Dot, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“Is—isn’t that <em>wicked</em>—like gambling?” asked
Tess, slowly, “or playing marbles for keeps?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” Neale told her, “I don’t believe it is.
You can take three straws of different lengths.
I’ll hold ’em. The one that draws the longest
straw takes the egg—and can have it cooked any
way she or he pleases.”
</p>
<p>
“But then the others won’t get any,” wailed
Dot, whose appetite was evidently sharpened by
the morning air.
</p>
<p>
“Shucks!” said Neale, washing his hands of the
matter. “Give it to Tom Jonah, then. He’ll eat
it raw—shell and all.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” said Tess, with sudden inspiration.
“We must give it to Mrs. Heard for her breakfast.
I’ll ask the blacksmith’s wife to cook it.”
</p>
<p>
That suited everybody and Tess and Dot ran to
make the proper culinary arrangements for the
wonderful egg laid on the automobile seat.
</p>
<p>
It was a very hilarious breakfast, indeed; and
the older girls and Mrs. Heard thought the “automobile
egg” quite wonderful indeed. And such a
breakfast as it was—with eggs galore, and fried
chicken, and hot bread, and honey from “Mother’s
own combs.”
</p>
<p>
When Dot heard that, she was puzzled a good
deal at first, for all the comb she had seen about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
the blacksmith’s wife was a high-backed, old-fashioned
tortoise-shell comb that was prominent in
the woman’s “bob” of hair. It had to be explained
to the smallest Corner House girl what
“honey from the comb” meant. All of that succulent
dainty Dot had ever seen before had been
strained honey.
</p>
<p>
The blacksmith’s wife put up a hamper of lunch
for the automobile tourists, too, and when they
drove away at nine o’clock the Corner House girls
and their companions felt as though they were bidding
good-bye to two old and valued friends. It
did not seem possible that they had never met the
jolly blacksmith and his kindly wife before the
previous evening; and they promised to stop
again, if only to call, on their return journey.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure we shall never forget the dears,”
Agnes sighed, some hours later, when they had
stopped for lunch. “Just <em>look</em> at all this fried
chicken!”
</p>
<p>
“We won’t forget ‘Mother’ while the grub holds
out, that’s sure,” grinned Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“Horrid boy!” retorted Agnes. “We girls, I
should hope, think of something besides our
stomachs.”
</p>
<p>
“Hm—yes. But you weren’t <em>talking</em> about anything
else,” rejoined Neale.
</p>
<p>
The party had another subject of thought the
next moment, however. Neale was just setting up
the tripod, and Sammy was scurrying about for
dry wood for the fire to be built under it, when a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
tall and roughly dressed man broke through the
brush into the open patch of turf on which the
party was preparing camp, and at once hailed
them:
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you! what are ye doing here, I’d like to
know?”
</p>
<p>
Neale took it upon himself to reply—and he did
not feel very pleasant about it. The man did not
speak in a nice way.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that it’s any of your affair,” the
boy said quietly; “but we are just preparing
lunch.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you <em>be?</em>” snarled the fellow. “Wal, by
jinks! ye <em>ben’t</em> neither! We don’t want no ortermobile
parties here. Get out!”
</p>
<p>
“Do you own this land?” asked Neale, his voice
shaking.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind him. Come away—do!” cried
Ruth to Neale, while she retreated to the car, dragging
the hamper with her.
</p>
<p>
“I hate to do that,” said the boy, who was very
angry. “I don’t believe he has any right to send
us away. We’re doing no harm.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye air trespassin’,” declared the man. “Going
to build a fire, too, was ye? That’s against
the law, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
“To build a campfire?” demanded Neale,
quickly. “I guess not. And you’ve got to prove
trespass.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll prove it with the flat o’ my hand on your
ears, ye young rascal!” declared the man, hotly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
“You ain’t paid anybody for the right to camp
here, have you?”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Paid</em> anybody? Of course not. Who’d we
pay?” demanded Neale, still inclined to stand his
ground.
</p>
<p>
“Shows ye don’t know the law in <em>this</em> town,”
said the man, with satisfaction. “I’m a consterble—see?”
and he threw back his coat and
showed a big, shiny star pinned to his “gallus.”
“I got the authority.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got the authority to <em>what?</em>” asked
Neale, sourly. “Trying to tree us for a collection,
are you? I—guess—not!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale,” begged Ruth. “Do come away.”
</p>
<p>
“The boy is right,” said Mrs. Heard, vigorously.
“I believe the man is overstepping his
rights. But we don’t want to fight him here. Oh!
what is that child about?”
</p>
<p>
Sammy Pinkney had procured several smooth
pebbles of about the size of hen’s eggs, and now
approached the contending parties. Tom Jonah,
too, stood beside Neale and began to show his remaining
fangs.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do with those stones,
Sammy Pinkney?” demanded Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Goin’ to give some of ’em to Neale if he wants
’em,” declared the youngster, with a grin.
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil laughed at that. “I guess we
won’t come to blows, Sammy,” he said. “We’ll
just get in the car and have our lunch. This constable
can’t keep us from eating on the county
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
road, that is sure. Get out the alcohol lamp, folks,
if you want your tea.”
</p>
<p>
They put up the board, and unlimbered the lamp
and soon had the kettle boiling; but the constable
sat down near by and watched them—and with
no pleasant face—the while. Evidently, although
they had obeyed his command, he was not wholly
satisfied.
</p>
<p>
It was while they were still eating their lunch
that the sky became overcast.
</p>
<p>
“It really looks as though we should have a
tempest, and we ought to get under cover,” remarked
Mrs. Heard.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, do!” said Agnes, eagerly. “I dislike
getting drenched.”
</p>
<p>
They were some distance on the road to Tailtown,
however, before the first flash of lightning
assured them that the storm was going to overtake
them before they could reach any haven.
</p>
<p>
Neale stopped immediately and put up the top
and drew the curtains on either side. He made
Agnes get back into the tonneau, although that
crowded the others somewhat. But under the rubber
blanket in front there was scarcely room for
Sammy, Neale, and Tom Jonah.
</p>
<p>
The rain began drumming on the top of the car
before they started again. They were in a locality
where there seemed to be no farms. At
least they had not passed a barn within the hour
that promised shelter for the car. So it was better
to go ahead and risk it, than to run back.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—A VERY ANNOYING SITUATION</h2>
<p>
In a minute or two the rain was falling torrentially—beating
upon the automobile cover and
quickly turning the sandy road to an actual mire.
</p>
<p>
It grew rapidly dark, although it was only mid-afternoon.
Overhead the lightning crackled and
the thunder ricochetted from the distant hills.
The trees bordering the road swayed in the wind
and the weight of the falling rain bent them like
saplings.
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil could not drive the automobile rapidly,
much as they desired to reach a place of
refuge from the storm, for the wind-shield was
blurred so that he had to poke his head out at the
side every now and then to watch the road.
</p>
<p>
The roar of the elements was appalling. The
girls and Mrs. Heard shut their eyes and cowered
in the tonneau when the sharp flashes of lightning
came. But they were perfectly dry.
</p>
<p>
Sammy was in a state of hysterical delight. He
was not frightened, but he jumped every time the
thunder broke above them. Once Neale told him
to keep still, but Sammy cried:
</p>
<p>
“I can’t, Neale. I don’t mean to jump—and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
wouldn’t if it wasn’t for that old thunder. I know
the bolt of lightning I see won’t hit me—my dad
told me that. I guess if I was deaf so I wouldn’t
hear the thunder, I’d keep as still as still!”
</p>
<p>
Not much was said by the girls, and Tom Jonah
merely hung his pink tongue out like a flag, whining
sometimes when the thunder rolled; for, like
Sammy, he was mostly disturbed by it.
</p>
<p>
The narrow road ahead, as they swooped down
into a hollow, seemed to be flooded. The shallow
gutters could not contain the amount of water
which had fallen, and the wheels of the automobile
rolled through a brown stream of sand and water.
At the bottom of this hill was a sharp turn; but
Neale saw this in plenty of time. However, what
lay beyond was completely hidden by an outthrust
bank. The water in the driveway deepened as
they descended. Despite the hard going the automobile
gained momentum from the descent, and
Neale steered carefully.
</p>
<p>
“Just like riding through a river, ain’t it,
Neale?” shrieked Sammy.
</p>
<p>
Tom Jonah, as excited as Sammy himself,
barked. Neale punched the horn, although he did
not expect to meet anybody or anything in such
a storm and in such a lonely place. He slipped
in the clutch at the bottom of the hill, turning out
slightly to make the turn. He could not foresee
the result of this last move; but he realized his
mistake in just ten seconds—when it was too late.
</p>
<p>
The rear wheels skidded a little, and then the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
car, on the right side, slumped down into the mud
and water, hub deep, and stopped dead!
</p>
<p>
The girls screamed, and Mrs. Heard, too, was
frightened by the sudden jolt and the way the car
tipped over. It did seem for a moment or two
as though there might be a complete overturn.
</p>
<p>
“Now you’ve done it, Neale O’Neil!” cried
Agnes, in her excitement.
</p>
<p>
“I s’pose I made it rain, too,” sniffed Neale,
in disgust. “You give me a pain, Aggie.”
</p>
<p>
“What nonsense to blame Neale,” Ruth, the
fair-minded, hastened to put in. “What shall we
do?”
</p>
<p>
“Stay where we are and keep dry,” Mrs. Heard
declared, with decision.
</p>
<p>
“But Neale can’t get the car out of the mud
with us in it,” Agnes cried.
</p>
<p>
“Nor with you out of it, I reckon,” said the boy,
crossly; “wait till I see.”
</p>
<p>
He crawled out with some difficulty to look the
situation over, having to drive back Sammy and
Tom Jonah with decision. “I don’t want you two
ramping around out here,” he growled.
</p>
<p>
Neale had put on his slicker when the downpour
began, and it was well he had, for this was no
ordinary rain. The rush of water had filled the
gutter with sand in solution, and there was now a
regular quagmire where the wheels of the automobile
stood. The fury of the storm had somewhat
relaxed, but the rain fell steadily. Even
should the rain stop, the water would not run out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
of this spot for hours. It did not take “half an
eye,” as Neale himself said, to see that they were
stuck.
</p>
<p>
“And this is a nice place to spend the night in,”
complained Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Can nothing really be done, Neale?” asked
Mrs. Heard, much worried.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t get her out without help,” admitted the
boy, in a discouraged tone.
</p>
<p>
Tess and Dot were crying a little, and Sammy
looked at them scornfully. “Aw, you kids make
me sick,” he said. “You don’t see me bawling, do
you? S’pose you was in a pirate ship, ‘way out
in the ocean, and she was wrecked?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to be a pirate—so there!” sobbed
Dot.
</p>
<p>
Tess said, solemnly: “Wait till you get hungry,
Sammy Pinkney.”
</p>
<p>
This silenced Sammy—for the time being, at
least.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Agnes cried aloud: “Oh, dear me!
here it comes again.”
</p>
<p>
It certainly sounded as though the tempest were
returning, there was such a rattling and jangling
behind them on the hill. Neale ran around the
automobile to look.
</p>
<p>
A big wagon with a tarpaulin over it, making it
look as large as a load of hay, and drawn by a
pair of drenched horses, came rattling down the
hill. There were two figures in slickers and rubber
hats on the seat under the hood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
“A tin peddler’s outfit, sure as you live,” he
cried.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, Neale,” said Ruth, “maybe they will
be rough men and will not help you.”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon they’ll help us if we make it worth
their while,” said the boy, with assurance, peering
through the rain to try to make out the faces
of the two on the wagon seat.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful, boy,” said Mrs. Heard. “Don’t
show them much money. We don’t know what
sort of men they may be. Peddlers——”
</p>
<p>
Neale reached back into the car and seized a
heavy wrench. “Nothing like ‘preparedness,’”
he said, with a grin.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” exclaimed Agnes, giggling
suddenly, “they’ll think you are a highway
robber.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to hold them up all right,” returned
Neale O’Neil, with assurance.
</p>
<p>
The wagon was evidently hung with a large supply
of tinware and the like, but all under the canvas
cover. Yet it came down the hill at such a
pace that the horses must not have found their
load a heavy one to draw.
</p>
<p>
Of course the two strangers saw Neale, and the
stalled car could not be overlooked, either. The
one driving pulled in his team. Neale could make
out the features of neither, for the turned-down
brims of their hats hid their faces.
</p>
<p>
But the one driving called out in a very pleasant
and unexpectedly cultivated voice:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hello there! What’s the matter? In a
hole?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just what we <em>are</em> in,” Neale responded,
and immediately tossed the wrench back into the
car. He knew they had nothing to fear from a
man with a voice like that.
</p>
<p>
“Is she in deep?” asked the stranger.
</p>
<p>
“You can see how she’s bogged down,” Neale
returned. “No chance of my humping her out
under her own engine, that’s sure.”
</p>
<p>
“You need something more—about two-horse
power, eh?” said the driver of the peddler’s cart,
with a laugh.
</p>
<p>
“It must be a very annoying situation,” said the
second person on the seat of the cart.
</p>
<p>
Neale fairly jumped. It was a most astonishing
thing, and he gaped impolitely for a moment up
into the speaker’s face. It was a girl!
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil was sure that she laughed at his
surprise. But the young man said nothing further
as he wrapped the lines around the whipstock
and began to climb down.
</p>
<p>
By this time the Corner House girls were peering
out of the curtains of the automobile, very
much interested. The young man, when he got
upon the ground, appeared to be about twenty-one,
and his face was keen and pleasant, if not handsome.
It seemed very queer indeed to find two
young people of this character driving a tin peddler’s
wagon through the country.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
“It is a girl!” whispered Agnes, shrilly.
“Goodness me! what fun!”
</p>
<p>
“And a <em>nice</em> girl, too,” murmured Ruth.
“That man looks like a college student.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you s’pose they are on their honeymoon?”
suggested the romantic Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake don’t ask them till you are a
little better acquainted,” begged Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard asked the strange girl: “Won’t
you get wet up there?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no; I’m quite dry, thanks. And then I
can go inside the wagon if it gets <em>too</em> rough.”
</p>
<p>
Not only Mrs. Heard, but the girls expressed
their surprise at this statement.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” explained the girl, “we have the
cart fixed like a van inside. We can sleep in it
if we don’t want to put up our tent. It’s very
cozy indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” said Mrs. Heard, “this seems to be an
entirely new idea. And do you really peddle
tinware?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes. Just like other peddlers. Only the
country people would rather trade with us, for we
look honest,” and she laughed merrily. “Besides,
we did it last summer, too, and almost everybody
remembers us in this country.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think it would be splendid!” cried
Agnes, with her usual enthusiasm over anything
new.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes; it’s fine. And we are having a nice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
vacation, Luke and I. Luke is my brother. Luke
Shepard. I am Cecile.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth at once gave in turn the names of the automobile
party. Meanwhile Dot said to Tess:
</p>
<p>
“I guess <em>she</em> knows how to be a wild girl better’n
you and me did,” and Tess agreed, though with a
whispered protest over her sister’s grammar.
</p>
<p>
Neale and young Mr. Shepard had finally decided
that the only way to get the car out of the
mire was to unhitch the team from the peddler’s
wagon and use that “two horse power engine.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll all have to get out while it’s being done,
too,” said Neale to his party. “There’ll be
weight enough for one pair of horses, at best.”
</p>
<p>
At once Cecile Shepard hopped down from the
seat of the cart, and while the boys unhitched the
horses, she got an umbrella and took Mrs. Heard
first from the automobile to the rear of the van.
There were steps and a door which gave entrance
to the strange vehicle; and a lamp was quickly
lighted inside. Then Cecile came back with the
umbrella for the girls, and the entire touring
party, save Neale and Tom Jonah, but including
Sammy, were soon cozily ensconced in the peddler’s
wagon.
</p>
<p>
The Corner House girls were delighted with the
way the van was arranged—and they were delighted
with the cheerful, intelligent Cecile Shepard,
too. They had a very talkative time while
the boys worked hard to get the stranded automobile
out of the mud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
The rain thundered down upon the huge tarpaulin
that covered the van. A sweet breath of damp
air blew through the wagon from the opening in
front to the open door behind. Cecile told them
something of the experiences of herself and her
brother as tin peddlers.
</p>
<p>
Luke had a rope long enough to surround the
body of the stalled automobile, so that the strain
could be properly distributed. He and Neale
tackled on the horses and carefully started them.
</p>
<p>
At the second trial the automobile wheels came
out of the mud, and she rolled out upon the harder
center of the road.
</p>
<p>
“Whoop—ee!” yelled Neale. “Now we’re all
right. And—and the rain is stopping! What do
you know about that?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—THE TIN BADGE OF THE LAW</h2>
<p>
“The roads will be full of mudholes for miles,”
said Luke Shepard. “Never mind if it does stop
raining, it will be bad traveling for an automobile.
You see, I know this section of the country pretty
well.”
</p>
<p>
“Cracky!” groaned Neale. “We may get into
another mess, then.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re likely to do so,” agreed Luke. “Of
course, by morning, if it rains no more, the water
will have practically all run off. The roads being
sandy hereabout they soon dry out.”
</p>
<p>
“And meanwhile we’ll be running risks every
mile,” growled Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“Every rod,” said Luke, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“Cracky! but you’re a cheerful fellow,” said the
boy from Milton. “Don’t let the girls hear you
say it. Agnes, especially. She’ll go up in the
air.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d better take shelter with us, then,” proposed
the young tinware peddler.
</p>
<p>
“How’s that?” asked Neale, curiously. “Not
in that party-wagon of yours? We’d sure be a
‘close corporation.’”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no!” and the other laughed. “We’re going
to Alonzo Keech’s barn. It’s up a side road a
piece—just around this turn. That’s where sis
and I were heading for. You see,” Luke Shepard
further explained, “we have established a regular
route for our wares, and we have been here before—and
put up at Keech’s barn, too.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Cecile Shepard had suggested the
same thing to Mrs. Heard and the Corner House
girls. They all agreed to this, for to the automobile
touring party it was “any port in a storm.”
</p>
<p>
The boys rehitched the span of very good horses
to the peddler’s wagon, Luke got on the driver’s
seat and the girls and Sammy returned to the
automobile, and the procession started, the peddler’s
wagon going ahead to lead the way.
</p>
<p>
Neale was very careful to keep in the middle of
the road thereafter; for although the rain had
ceased, as Luke foretold, the roads were still
rivers. The branch road they turned into led back
in the same general direction from which the tourists
had come; but that made no difference now.
It was shelter for the night they wanted, and in
the on-coming darkness and the storm they all
felt only too glad to be led without question.
</p>
<p>
In a half hour or so, they came out of the woods,
after surmounting a hill, and found open fields all
about them. The sky remained overcast and it
was a dark night; but it was better here in the
open than in the woods where the accident to the
automobile had happened. There was not a gleam
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
of lamplight anywhere; and when the peddler’s
wagon stopped finally in front of a great hay barn,
Luke Shepard assured them that the dwelling of
the owner of the farm was beyond a patch of woods
and could not be seen even in daylight.
</p>
<p>
“I hope he will not object to our stopping here,”
Mrs. Heard said, when she climbed down from the
van, in which she had stayed for the ride to the
barn.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. We have had one experience with the
natives,” Agnes said, laughing, “that was not
pleasant.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Mr. Keech will not object,” Cecile assured
them. “We have found the people around
here very nice indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“So have we—for the most part,” Ruth hastened
to say. “Nobody could be nicer than the
people we stayed with last night”; and she told
the Shepards about the blacksmith and “Mother.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we know them! <em>They</em> are the salt of the
earth!” cried Cecile.
</p>
<p>
“Then that constable that wouldn’t let us eat
our lunch in the woods over yonder must be the
pepper,” said Neale, with a grin.
</p>
<p>
Luke and Cecile had to be told about that. But
they did not recognize the officious constable.
</p>
<p>
“He must be a new one, and feels his oats,”
said Luke.
</p>
<p>
“I think he was a cheap grafter and wanted to
be tipped,” said Neale O’Neil. “That’s what <em>I</em>
think.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
</p>
<p>
“But of course he was an officer of the law,”
Mrs. Heard said. “He wore a badge.”
</p>
<p>
“‘The tin badge of courage,’” said Luke with
a laugh. “I don’t know who he could be. But
this Mr. Keech who owns this place is the county
sheriff. So we have the law on our side while we
stop here. Mr. Keech is our friend. We shall
stop at his house to-morrow and spend most of the
day. We always do when we get around this
way.”
</p>
<p>
The door of the barn was found unbarred, and
with the automobile lights and Luke’s lanterns,
the party “made camp” very nicely indeed. The
automobile was backed in on the floor of the barn,
and the big doors left open. The Shepards’ tent—a
very good wall tent—was erected on a well-drained
piece of ground. It was decided that Mrs.
Heard and the girls should sleep in the tent and in
the van, while the male members of the two parties
put back the motor car cover and made themselves
comfortable on the cushioned seats of the car.
</p>
<p>
Of course, supper came before this scheme of
retiring had been adjusted. And a delightful time
they had getting the meal and eating it. The food
was mostly supplied by the “tin peddlers,” as
Agnes insisted upon calling Luke and Cecile
Shepard.
</p>
<p>
“I shall lay in some condensed foods myself
just as soon as we find a town again,” declared
Mrs. Heard. “These chances of being caught in
lonely places without anything to eat come too frequently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
Touring the country in a motor car is
not very different from being cast away on a desert
island!”
</p>
<p>
The children, of course, thought the experience
quite as exciting as anything that had previously
occurred.
</p>
<p>
“I like it better than the Gypsy camp,” said Dot,
warmly. “That cart we are going to sleep in is
just the <em>cutest</em> thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Just the same, I am glad Tom Jonah is with
us this time,” Tess said. “Everything is so sort
of open around here.”
</p>
<p>
The presence of the big dog made them all feel
safer when the time to retire came, although the
Shepards were used to camping out, and had never
yet been molested in their two years’ experience.
</p>
<p>
The two parties gave each other full personal
particulars. The brother and sister had friends
in Milton, whom the Corner House girls knew.
And then, there was another bond between Luke
and Cecile Shepard and the four Corner House
girls. They were all orphans.
</p>
<p>
Luke was in his sophomore year at college. Cecile
was attending a preparatory school, and was
going to have a college education, too. But they
had partly to work for it, for their only relative
was a maiden aunt who could help them but little,
and there had been only money enough left by their
mother to partly educate the brother and sister.
</p>
<p>
“And we get a nice vacation and lots of fun
and some money by going out with our van for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
three months each year,” Cecile explained. “The
rest of the year we rent the horses and van and
the route to a man who has a little restaurant business
at the shore in the summer. So we do pretty
well.”
</p>
<p>
Tom Jonah, as watchman, made no sound all
night long. The weather gradually cleared, and
at daybreak there was every promise of a beautiful
day, with everything washed clean by the
rain.
</p>
<p>
The motoring party decided to make an early
start—and without breakfast. The Shepards
knew just where there was a good roadside hotel
only twenty miles away, and Neale was sure they
would get there in season for breakfast.
</p>
<p>
Their host and hostess, however, insisted upon
their having coffee before they started, and when
the automobile got under way, the Corner House
girls and their party felt, as they had the morning
previous, that they were leaving some very good
friends behind. They hoped to meet Luke and
Cecile again on their return trip; if not, Cecile was
to write to Ruth. The “tin peddlers” had also
promised to make the old Corner House, in Milton,
a visit during the next winter.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me suz!” sighed Agnes, as they wheeled
away, using one of Mrs. MacCall’s exclamations,
“isn’t this just delightful? I think touring the
country in this way, and meeting folks, and making
friends, is just delightful.”
</p>
<p>
“Not so delightful last night when that storm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
was beating down upon us,” Mrs. Heard reminded
her.
</p>
<p>
“And you did your share of the kicking then,
all right all right,” put in Neale O’Neil. “Oh,
you did squall, Aggie.”
</p>
<p>
“Horrid thing!” exclaimed Agnes. “Don’t remind
me of unpleasant things this morning. I
feel—I feel as happy as a big sunflower.”
</p>
<p>
Just then they turned a curve in the level road
and saw a lanky man in a drooping-brimmed hat,
standing in the middle of the way.
</p>
<p>
“Hul-<em>lo</em>!” ejaculated Neale, slowing down.
</p>
<p>
“Is the man deaf?” demanded Mrs. Heard.
</p>
<p>
Neale punched the horn a couple of times, and
the man merely turned to face them and held up
a warning hand.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, cracky!” cried Neale. “Another tin-badger.”
</p>
<p>
“And he’s holding one of those tin watches on
us, too,” said Agnes, in despair.
</p>
<p>
“Say!” observed Sammy, the sharp-eyed.
“That’s the cop that wouldn’t let us build the fire
yesterday.”
</p>
<p>
“It certainly <em>is</em>,” gasped Ruth. “Now what
shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“I feel like bumping him,” growled Neale.
Nevertheless, he shut off the engine as the constable
seemed to have no intention of moving out
of the road.
</p>
<p>
“Wal!” said the tall man, finally facing them
completely and snapping the case of his watch shut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
in a very business-like way. “Got ye that time, I
swan! Comin’ fifty mile an hour if ye was an
inch——”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he discovered that he was not entirely
a stranger to the touring party. His mouth
sagged open for a moment and he did not continue
his remarks before Neale got in a word or
two.
</p>
<p>
“You are very much mistaken, constable,” he
said. “I could not drive this car on this road at
the speed you state—and if you knew anything
about an auto <em>you’d</em> know it, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t, Neale!” whispered Ruth, from behind.
</p>
<p>
“So! I’ve seen ye before, have I, young cock o’
the walk?” snarled the constable. “You was running
over speed, an’ don’t you fergit it. And I’m
goin’ to take ye all back to Tuckerville and let
Jedge Winslow tell ye sumpin’.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” moaned Agnes. “And we
haven’t had breakfast!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard here put in her word—and she spoke
sternly:
</p>
<p>
“You are making a grave mistake, Mr. Officer.
We do not drive our automobile at any time faster
than the law allows. And certainly we were not
doing so now. How do you <em>know</em> how fast we
were coming? You could not even see us until
we came around that curve.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ve had experience, <em>I</em> have, ma’am,” said
the fellow with a mean grin on his homely face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p>
“This is a regular hold-up!” exclaimed Neale,
in wrath. “Why didn’t you pull a gun and tell us
to hold up our hands while you went through our
pockets? It wouldn’t be any worse.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m likely to pull me a good switch an’ wear it
out on ye, ye fresh Ike!” declared the constable.
“Don’t you hand me no more sass—now I warn
ye.”
</p>
<p>
“But to go away back to Tuckerville!” groaned
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“And not a hotel there,” Agnes said.
</p>
<p>
“I do not believe any justice of the peace will
uphold this fellow if we <em>do</em> appear before him,”
Mrs. Heard said.
</p>
<p>
“If ye don’t want to go,” said the constable,
whose ears seemed to be as preternaturally keen
as they were unnaturally large—“if ye don’t want
to go back to Tuckerville, ye kin pay yer fine right
here—ten dollars. That’ll be about right, unless
I add on a coupla dollars more to pay for this
boy’s sass.”
</p>
<p>
“What did I tell you?” exclaimed Neale, to the
others. “It’s a hold-up!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—EXCITEMENT</h2>
<p>
Neale O’Neil may not have been very wise in
talking so plainly in the hearing of the mean-spirited
fellow; but he could not be blamed for being
indignant. It was positive that the Corner
House girls’ automobile had not been speeding
when the man with the badge stopped it. And
now his demand for ten dollars showed plainly that
his petty mind was interested only in getting
money easily rather than in enforcing the law.
</p>
<p>
“You’d better keep a civil lip on you, young
man,” said the constable, scowling at Neale.
Then to Mrs. Heard he added: “Come now, lady,
you can pay the fine to me and drive on; or you
can go back to Tuckerville under arrest and pay it
to Jedge Winslow. Take yer ch’ice.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” whispered Agnes. “Let’s give
him the money and go on to the hotel Cecile Shepard
told us about. Tuckerville, they say, is an
awful place.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Pay him the ten dollars—do, Mrs.
Heard,” Ruth urged the chaperone.
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” said the lady. “I disapprove of
such a thing, but it at least will relieve us of this
man’s presence——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
“Here comes another car,” cried Tess, who was
not wholly attentive to the argument.
</p>
<p>
“Now you’ll get a chance to sting another
party,” snapped Neale, glaring at the constable.
</p>
<p>
But the latter made him no reply. In fact, he
had suddenly changed his attitude. Instead of
standing boldly before the machine, he cringed
along to the tonneau door with his hand held out
for the money Mrs. Heard was selecting from her
bag.
</p>
<p>
“Hold on!” exclaimed Neale, suddenly.
“Don’t pay that fellow too quickly. Let’s have
witnesses. Here comes the car.”
</p>
<p>
“You pay me now, or ’twill be too late,” cried
the constable, angrily.
</p>
<p>
Just then the coming car appeared around the
curve—a heavy roadster. The plainly frightened
constable gave the single occupant of the car one
glance, and instantly turned without the money
and ran.
</p>
<p>
“Hi! stop that fellow!” shouted the man in the
car.
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” responded Neale O’Neil,
joyfully, and, scrambling out of his seat, he gave
chase to the lanky man.
</p>
<p>
The fellow did not keep long to the road, but
vaulted a rail fence and started across a muddy
field. Neale, protected by his leggings, did not
mind the mud, and kept on after the rascal. He
had a pretty well defined idea that this fellow who
had tried to collect money from Mrs. Heard had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
merely played constable and was nothing more
than a cheap robber. Neale was so angry that he
was determined not to let the fellow get away.
</p>
<p>
He heard the second automobile stop, and supposed
the man in it was following, too; but he
did not glance back to see. Just then he felt that
he could master the lanky man alone, if need be.
</p>
<p>
And that is exactly what happened. The fellow
got to the other side of the field with Neale gaining
on him at every jump. Once in the woods there,
however, the Milton boy feared the fugitive would
be able to hide from him. So Neale increased his
pace, sprinting for the last few rods, and caught
the fellow just as he reached the fence. Neale
tackled low, in true football fashion, and brought
the long-legged man down with a crash. There
they both rolled on the muddy ground, Neale clinging
to the fellow’s knees, and the latter clawing
and snarling like a wildcat.
</p>
<p>
Sammy Pinkney had followed the chase as far
as the top rail of the roadside fence, where Mrs.
Heard had commanded him in no uncertain tone to
stop. There the little fellow stood, waving his
cap and yelling encouragement to Neale O’Neil,
while the stranger from the second automobile
strode across the field at a rapid gait.
</p>
<p>
“Good boy!” shouted this stranger, heartily.
“Hang on to him.”
</p>
<p>
Neale hung. His face was scratched and his
clothing muddy; but the long-legged fellow could
not do him very much harm before help came. Indeed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
when he once saw that he was bound to be
captured he stopped struggling and began actually
to blubber.
</p>
<p>
“I was only foolin’,” he whined. “Lemme up,
boy. I wouldn’t hurt ye.”
</p>
<p>
“I know you won’t hurt me,” snapped Neale.
“I won’t let you—that’s why.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold on to him!” shouted the other man again.
</p>
<p>
Neale let the rascal up; but he hung to his coat-collar
with both hands.
</p>
<p>
“I was just a-foolin’,” repeated the captive, and
he actually shook with terror. “Ye know, Sheriff,
I’m always foolin’.”
</p>
<p>
Neale looked then with increased interest upon
the big man who was approaching. This must be
Sheriff Keech, Luke Shepard’s friend.
</p>
<p>
“So you got the ornery critter, did you?” demanded
the county officer, panting from his exertions.
“Good boy.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, say, now, Sheriff! you know I’m only
foolin’,” almost wept the captive.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know you’re the town cut-up, Abe,”
growled the sheriff. “But this time you’ll have a
chance to think it over in jail. Why!” he added,
to Neale, “I knew who this must be the minute
Luke Shepard told me about him; and as I saw
him come down the road about an hour ago, I had
a hunch I’d just about catch him at his capers.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, Sheriff,” begged the fellow. “Don’t you
be too hard on me. I jest found that star——”
</p>
<p>
“You are a rascal!” snapped the county officer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
“You sent off to a mail-order house and bought
that bum badge and just couldn’t keep from flirting
around with it. Showing what you thought
you’d do if you <em>was</em> a constable. Oh, I’ll put you
where the dogs won’t bite you.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I never collected no money from ’em,”
whined the would-be constable.
</p>
<p>
“No. That’s because I came along just a little
too soon. I wish you had got the money.
Then I would have had you to rights, sure
enough,” declared the sheriff, bitterly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let him go, young man. He won’t run
now; for if he does he’ll be resisting arrest, and
that’ll fix him with the judge for sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, say, he isn’t right in the head, is he?”
demanded Neale O’Neil, wonderingly. “Making
out to be a constable, and robbing people, and all
that?”
</p>
<p>
“He’s one of these half-baked critters you find
once in so often that take correspondence school
courses to learn to be detectives, and all that sort
of mush. Ugh!”
</p>
<p>
“Abe” was a very forlorn looking creature as
he came out to the road. Sammy on the fence
waved his cap again and cheered.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you, Neale, you’re some runner,” declared
the boy, enthusiastically. “What are you
going to do—hang him?”
</p>
<p>
“That horrid child!” exclaimed Agnes. “I
never heard of such a bloodthirsty boy before.”
</p>
<p>
But the rest of the party were inclined to feel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
that the punishment to be meted out to the fellow
who had posed as constable could not be too harsh.
</p>
<p>
Sheriff Keech ordered Abe to get into his car,
and seemed to have no fear that the mean-spirited
fellow might try to run away again.
</p>
<p>
“I know Abe,” he said to Mrs. Heard, when she
suggested this possibility. “He hasn’t any more
character than a dishrag. He’s arrested now, and
he knows it. He wouldn’t dare run away from me
once I’ve put my hand on him.
</p>
<p>
“Now, ma’am, tell me all about it.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard had plenty of help in relating the
circumstances surrounding the touring party’s
two adventures with this Abe. Everybody wanted
to tell what he or she thought of the fellow, even
to Dot. The latter said, with conviction:
</p>
<p>
“He is not a nice man at all, and I’m awfully
glad he doesn’t live anywhere near <em>our</em> house.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that any neighborhood would give
Abe a bonus for moving into it,” chuckled Mr.
Keech. “Well! I won’t detain you. I can scare
him bad enough as it is. And thirty days in jail
will do Abe a world of good. I won’t keep you
folks as witnesses; you’ve had trouble enough.”
</p>
<p>
So the matter was settled very amicably, and the
touring party from Milton hastened on to the Wayside
Rose Inn, at Brampton, for breakfast.
</p>
<p>
“One thing we never thought about,” Agnes
said to Neale, when they had bidden Sheriff Keech
good-bye.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, about Mr. Collinger’s car and that Joe
Dawson fellow. My! what mean people we <em>do</em>
manage to meet.”
</p>
<p>
“And a little while ago you were thinking what
good folks we had met,” laughed Neale. “But
you are mistaken, Aggie. I spoke to the sheriff
about Saleratus Joe and his mate and the lost car.
Nothing doing. I’ve asked everybody else we
have talked with—the blacksmith and Luke Shepard
and all—about that bunch.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! have you, Neale?” cried Mrs. Heard.
“And has nothing come of it?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Mrs. Heard,” said the boy, “all trace of
that car and those fellows seems to have ended
right there at the Higgins’ farm—where the
Gypsy king saw them for the last time. That’s
the way it looks to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” sighed Agnes. “I wish you’d
have let <em>me</em> hunt in that barn for the car.”
</p>
<p>
“Or <em>me</em>,” put in Sammy, with confidence.
</p>
<p>
“Say! you two give me a pain,” cried Neale, and
refused to talk about it any further.
</p>
<p>
They made a fine run that day, getting on good
roads again, and they spent the night with friends
of Mrs. Heard’s who had been on the lookout for
them for two days. A letter was waiting for the
chaperone from her nephew, stating that the police
were looking for Saleratus Joe and another man in
connection with the disappearance of the Maybrouke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
runabout, and that the information she had
sent might aid in the arrest of the automobile
thieves.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Agnes, “of course I hope the police
catch them; but it would be fun if <em>we</em> could
bring about their arrest and find the machine, too,
Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let it worry you, Aggie,” he advised.
“There isn’t any reward offered, so you’d have
your work for your pains.”
</p>
<p>
Just the same, neither of them forgot the matter,
and it was a topic of conversation between
them, now and then, throughout the entire tour.
</p>
<p>
They went on as far as Fort Kritchton, and
spent the week-end at the Monolith Hotel there,
to which their trunks had been forwarded. The
car needed some slight repairs, and the girls found
pleasant friends. This point was to be the farthest
they expected to travel from Milton.
</p>
<p>
Neale found a party of boys camping up in the
woods above the hotel, and he enjoyed himself,
too; but he had to take Sammy along with him
most of the time, and he declared to Agnes that if
he ever went anywhere again and had his choice
of taking Sammy or a flea, he would choose the
flea!
</p>
<p>
“You have no more idea of where to find him
from one moment to another than a flea,” growled
the older boy. “I’m coming to the old bachelor’s
belief in the treatment and bringing up of boys.”
</p>
<p>
“What is that?” asked the amused Agnes, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
had had her own experiences with Sammy Pinkney.
</p>
<p>
“Why, the crabbed old bachelor, who had six
small nephews, declared he believed all boys
should be taken at about three years of age and
put in barrels, the heads nailed on, and that they
should be fed through the bungholes.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” laughed Agnes. “And when they
grew up?”
</p>
<p>
“‘Drive in the bungs,’” declared Neale, seriously.
“That was his creed and I am about ready
to subscribe to it.”
</p>
<p>
Sammy, however, had a good time. He confided
to Mrs. Heard and Ruth that he had never had
such a good time in his life. He got letters and
money from his mother and father, just as the
Corner House girls did, likewise, from home; and
he was actually growing sturdy looking as well as
brown.
</p>
<p>
“Whether this tour does anybody else good or
not, Sammy P. is being helped,” declared Mrs.
Heard.
</p>
<p>
“‘Sammy P. Buttinsky,’” sniffed Agnes.
“Such a plague. I believe his mother will lose
ten years of her age in appearance during this
time of Sammy’s absence. She certainly ought
to be our friend for life.”
</p>
<p>
After all, however, they none of them could
really be “mad at” Sammy, as Tess said. He was
a plague; but there was something really attractive
about him, too.
</p>
<p>
“He is the most un-moral child I ever heard of,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
Ruth said. “He seems to have stepped right out
of the stone age.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard smiled at that statement. “My
dear girl,” she said, “most boys are that way.
Philly Collinger was—and look at him now,” for
Mrs. Heard was very proud indeed of the county
surveyor. “I think there is one very helpful thing
that you Corner House girls are missing.”
</p>
<p>
“What is that, Mrs. Heard?” asked Ruth, in
curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“You have missed having a brother or two.
They are great educators for the feminine mind,”
laughed the lady.
</p>
<p>
However, Sammy behaved himself pretty well—considering—all
the time the touring party remained
at the Monolith Hotel. The little girls
whom Tess and Dot played with looked somewhat
askance at Sammy, for his boasted intention of
following in the sanguinary wake of Captain Kidd,
Blackbeard, and Sir Henry Morgan, set him as a
creature apart from the rest of boykind. In fact,
among the little folk, Sammy Pinkney was quite
the sensation for several days. Then little Eddie
Haflinger developed a carbuncle on the back of his
neck and Sammy’s swashbuckling tendencies
rather paled before the general interest in Eddie’s
stiff neck.
</p>
<p>
However, everybody had a good time at Fort
Kritchton; but the “call of the wild,” as Agnes
expressed it, was the stronger. They had had so
many adventures—pleasant as well as disconcerting—on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
the road, that even Mrs. Heard was glad
when the time came to leave the resort.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s send our trunks right back to Milton,”
Agnes said. “No more ‘Fluffy Ruffles’ for mine
till we get home. Let’s rough it.”
</p>
<p>
Their bags in the automobile really did contain
all they would need, so it was agreed to live in
plain and serviceable garments for the rest of the
trip.
</p>
<p>
“If we run short of clean linen and handkerchiefs,”
said Ruth, “we shall have to stop and do
our washing in a brook. How about that?”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you’ll want to stretch lines over the
auto and dry your clothes as we travel,” growled
Neale O’Neil. “<em>Then</em> if we meet some fidgety
old farmer-woman with a more fidgety horse—<em>good</em>-night!”
</p>
<p>
“I wish,” Agnes declared, “that we had brought
a tent with us—a nice one like the Shepards have.
Wouldn’t it have been fun to camp out every night—just
like those Gypsies?”
</p>
<p>
“How about it when it rained?” asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ve been out in one rainstorm—and
we’re neither sugar nor salt,” said her sister,
sticking to her guns.
</p>
<p>
“But never again—if I can help it,” cried Mrs.
Heard. “It is all right for you young folks; but
my blood is not so young as yours; nor is my appetite
for adventure and what you call ‘fun’ quite so
keen as it used to be.”
</p>
<p>
It was a fact. The young folks only laughed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
at that memorable experience when they were
overtaken by the storm. It was all what Agnes
called “fun.”
</p>
<p>
The touring party planned a roundabout way
home to Milton, in order to see a part of the
country that they had not before driven through.
</p>
<p>
“And we’ll take the good roads, too. I understand
more about this map and guide book than I
did,” proclaimed Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
However, at one point they agreed to leave the
better traveled roads so as to spend another night
with the crossroads blacksmith and “Mother.”
And they half hoped to meet the Shepards near
there, also.
</p>
<p>
“That’ll bring us around past the Higgins
farm, too,” Neale said, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! I want to take a look into that
barn myself,” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw!” responded her boy friend. “If that
car of Mr. Collinger’s was ever there, Saleratus
Joe and his chum have got it away long since, of
course.”
</p>
<p>
But Agnes was hopeful. She usually was of a
sanguine mind.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS</h2>
<p>
The automobile party did not travel all day
long—whirling over the dusty roads, past flower-spangled
fields, or through pleasant woods. No,
indeed.
</p>
<p>
Little folks especially—like Tess and Dot and
Sammy—cannot sit patiently, even in an upholstered
touring car, hour after hour. It was pleasant
to ride so smoothly through the lovely country;
it was nicer still to halt by the wayside and
hunt for adventure.
</p>
<p>
Tom Jonah, who was by nature a tramp, enjoyed
the excursions away from the automobile as much
as did the children—and he was never again off
their trail at such times. If Tess and Dot and
Sammy left the party, somebody would be sure to
speak to the old dog, and up he would get in order
to follow the children. He had not forgotten the
occasion when the two smallest Corner House girls
had escaped his watchful eye. So Tom Jonah was
what the slangy Sammy Pinkney called “Johnny
on the Spot” one day when something quite exciting
happened.
</p>
<p>
They had stopped beside the road for lunch, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
they almost always did, and as soon as they had
eaten the children were anxious to explore.
</p>
<p>
The almost dry bed of a water-course attracted
their attention, and as they could step from rock
to rock, and so keep their feet dry, they started up
this ravine. Sammy, of course, led and recklessly
leaped from rock to rock with the assurance of a
goat. The little girls were agile enough; but Tess
gave much attention to Dot, and the latter had to
be sure that the Alice-doll got into no difficulty.
</p>
<p>
“You mustn’t go so fast, Sammy,” urged Tess.
“You know we haven’t got to catch a train. And
<em>do</em> go away, Tom Jonah! You’re all wet. When
you shake yourself I’d just as lief be walking close
behind a sprinkling-cart.”
</p>
<p>
Both the boy and the dog laughed at her; but
Dot, realizing that Alice’s best gown might be
ruined, almost fell off her stepping-stone as Tom
Jonah deliberately shook himself again and she
tried to shield her doll’s finery.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, bully!” shouted Sammy, suddenly.
“There’s blackberries.”
</p>
<p>
The bushes were overhanging the steep wall of
the ravine on one side. Tess looked doubtfully up
the rocky slope.
</p>
<p>
“They’re mostly red, Sammy,” she objected.
“Or green.”
</p>
<p>
“Some of ’em’s black enough,” declared the
boy. “Come on! Let’s get some.”
</p>
<p>
Sammy scrambled up the rough side of the
gully. Tom Jonah bounded after him and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
looked back at his little mistresses to see if they
were coming too.
</p>
<p>
“Well! I won’t be beaten by a boy,” said Tess,
with sudden decision. “Let’s go too, Dot.”
</p>
<p>
It was a rather hard pull for the little girls; and
Dot got her knees “scrubby,” although she saved
the Alice-doll’s dress. They came to the top of
the height all but breathless and with flushed faces.
</p>
<p>
Sammy was coolly picking the best berries and
cramming them into a mouth which betrayed to all
who might behold his greediness. “You better
hurry up,” he advised, with a lofty detachment
from all chivalry, “or there won’t be any left.
There <em>ain’t</em> many ripe ones, after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I do declare!” exclaimed Tess. “You
aren’t very polite, Sammy Pinkney.”
</p>
<p>
“You—you might have saved us <em>some</em>!” protested
Dot.
</p>
<p>
The little girls looked all about. They did not
see any other blackberry bushes in the vicinity.
But Tess sighted something else.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dot! Roses! Lovely, pink, wild, roses!
Did you ever see so many?”
</p>
<p>
There was a veritable hedge of the pretty, fragrant,
delicate flowers at the far side of this little
field. The two girls raced over to them at once,
forgetting both Sammy’s greediness and the berries.
Tom Jonah bounded after them, and rushed
through a gap in the rose hedge. Instantly there
was excitement on the far side of the hedge, just
out of sight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
</p>
<p>
An angry and excited voice rose in a familiar:
“Bla-a-a-t! bla-a-a-t!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! what’s that?” asked Dot, startled.
</p>
<p>
“It sounds just like Billy Bumps,” said Tess.
</p>
<p>
Again it sounded: “Ba-a-a! bla-a-a-t!” Tom
Jonah barked. Sammy came running over to
them.
</p>
<p>
“Hear that old Billy goat?” he shouted. “I
bet Tom Jonah’s treed him!”
</p>
<p>
He dived through the break in the hedge and
perforce, because of their curiosity, the little Corner
House girls were drawn after him. There
they found both Tom Jonah and the boy dancing
about a rather savage-looking black-faced ram
that had been tied to a stump and that was now
so wound up in his rope that he could do little but
stamp his hoofs and shake his horns at his tormentors.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sammy! don’t worry the poor goat,”
begged Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Come here, Tom Jonah!” commanded Tess
sternly, and the dog obeyed if the boy did not.
</p>
<p>
“Aw, what’s the odds? He can’t get at us,”
said Sammy, careless of both his grammar and
the ethics of the case. “And he’s only an old
goat.”
</p>
<p>
“That is just horrid of you, Sammy Pinkney!”
declared Tess. “Suppose it was our own poor
Billy Bumps?”
</p>
<p>
The girls, no more than the boy, did not recognize
the difference between the goat they knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
well and the ram that they had never seen before.
The black-faced rogue had been tied because it was
not safe to let him run loose with the herd.
</p>
<p>
“We <em>must</em> help him,” declared Tess, having
made Tom Jonah go to the rear. “We can’t leave
him tied here to suffer—and all wound up in that
rope. If Neale were only here——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes!” agreed Dot. “Neale would fix it all
right.”
</p>
<p>
“Say,” declared Sammy, spurred to the quick,
“<em>I</em> ain’t afraid. If Neale could do it, I guess I
can. But just the same, I bet if we let him loose
he’ll chase us.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no! he wouldn’t do that, would he?” cried
Dot.
</p>
<p>
“He wouldn’t be so ungrateful,” said Tess severely.
</p>
<p>
“Poor, poor old Billy,” cooed Dot, putting out
her hand to the ram.
</p>
<p>
“He—he doesn’t look just like our goat; but I
know he’s suffering,” Tess declared.
</p>
<p>
The noise the ram made would naturally lead
one to think that he was suffering. If not urged
on by this appearance, Sammy desired to make a
certain impression upon his companions. He
walked boldly up to the stump to which the ram
was tethered. Things began to happen immediately!
That black-faced ram had no more idea of
gratitude than a rattlesnake.
</p>
<p>
Sammy got two loops of the rope off the stump,
and another off the ram’s hind leg. The beast immediately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
put down its head and bumped Sammy
just as hard as he possibly could.
</p>
<p>
“Ow! Ouch!” yelled Sammy. “Get out, you
mean thing!”
</p>
<p>
“Bla-a-at!” said the ram, and tried to charge
again. Sammy attempted to scramble out of the
way; the little girls screamed; Tom Jonah began
to bark and to jump about the excited party.
</p>
<p>
The ram ran several times around the stump in
the right direction to unwind his rope; but in so
doing he got Sammy and the rope entangled. In
a moment more the modern pirate was lashed to
the post, yelling vigorously, while the ram was
brought to a stop again on too short a rope to do
the boy any damage with his ugly horns, although
he threatened Sammy continuously.
</p>
<p>
The screams of the three children and the barking
of Tom Jonah was bound to raise the neighborhood.
A shout soon replied, and the screaming
of other youthful voices. Into the field at its
far end came a man, running, and close upon his
heels several ragged and bare-legged children, both
boys and girls.
</p>
<p>
“What are ye doin’ there, ye little imps?”
roared the man, bearing down on the little Corner
House girls and their unfortunate champion in a
very ugly way.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, <em>do</em> help Sammy!” begged Tess, with
clasped hands, of the ugly man.

<p>
Dot, hugging the Alice-doll closely, stared wonderingly
at the horde of little ragamuffins that
came dancing and screeching to the scene of
Sammy’s disaster.
</p>
<p>
“Take him off, mister, an’ lemme get away,”
cried Sammy. “I won’t never do it again.”
</p>
<p>
It was so natural for Sammy Pinkney to be
blamed in whatever situation he found himself,
that he offered his apologies at once. The ugly
man scowled down at him.
</p>
<p>
“I’d oughter let old Dewey lam’ you good,” he
growled.
</p>
<p>
“Cut the rope and let old Dewey go for ’em,
Uncle Jim!” yelled one of the young savages.
</p>
<p>
At that both Tess and Dot burst into despairing
wails. At the same moment Neale O’Neil and
Agnes burst through the bushes, having been
drawn to the spot by the uproar.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aggie!” shrieked Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” cried Dot.
</p>
<p>
Sammy pluckily held his tongue; but the way
he looked at the bigger boy belonging to the automobile
party would have touched a much stonier
heart than that of Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“Keep away from here,” commanded the ugly
man, to Neale.
</p>
<p>
“I guess not,” responded the boy sharply.
“<em>You</em> don’t seem to be doing anything to help
him.”
</p>
<p>
“What did he want to get tangled up with the
ram for, then?” demanded the fellow.
</p>
<p>
“He was trying to help the poor Billy goat,”
Tess sobbed, from the shelter of Agnes’ arms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p>
“You city folks are too fresh, anyhow,” cried
one of the ragged children. “We ought to stone
you kids. Hadn’t we, Uncle Jim?”
</p>
<p>
But the man was busy with Neale. “Let that
rope alone!” he commanded, as the boy approached
the entangled Sammy.
</p>
<p>
“Stand out of my way,” said Neale, taking out
his pocketknife and opening the big blade. “And
run your old sheep out of here when I cut him
free.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you do that!” cried the man.
</p>
<p>
But with one stroke of the sharp blade Neale
freed both the ram and Sammy.
</p>
<p>
“Ba-a-a! Bla-a-a-t!” uttered the ram, and
shook his horns threateningly at Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Butt him, Dewey!” yelled the ragamuffins.
</p>
<p>
But Neale delivered a hearty kick that resounded
upon the ram’s ribs. With another blat the beast
switched around, lowered his head, and charged
directly at the ugly man.
</p>
<p>
“Git out, ye derned nuisance!” yelled the fellow,
and only by leaping high and spreading wide
his legs did he escape the ram’s furious charge.
</p>
<p>
Missing his object, the ram kept on across the
field and, whooping, the rag-and-bobtail crew
strung along after him. The man remained to
bluster and threaten Neale for a while; but the
boy from Milton paid very little attention to him.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go! Let’s go!” Agnes kept saying, and
the little girls, thoroughly frightened, kept urging
the same thing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
</p>
<p>
But when they got down into the ravine again,
and the ugly man was out of sight, Agnes sent the
trio of little folks ahead, and said to Neale:
</p>
<p>
“Do you know, Neale, who that horrid man
was?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” grunted Neale, puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t you see who he was when he stood right
there before you?”
</p>
<p>
“Er—‘Hawkshaw, the detective’!” scoffed
Neale, grinning widely.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t try to be funny,” implored Agnes.
“Where were your eyes? <em>That</em> was the man we
saw the last time with Saleratus Joe, when they
passed us in that strange automobile,” declared
the girl earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“No?” gasped Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it was. I could never forget his ugly face.
He is the very man, I believe, who helped Joe steal
Mr. Collinger’s car.”
</p>
<p>
Neale wagged his head. “Whether he is one of
the thieves or not, he’s a bad man all right. You
can see that,” the boy agreed. “I wonder if we
ought to hunt up Sheriff Keech?” But they were
a long way from the residence of the sheriff whose
acquaintance they had previously made.
</p>
<p>
That night the touring party stopped with the
blacksmith and his wife. The Shepards had not
returned to this neighborhood, and the Corner
House party did not wish to waste any time.
They were to make a long detour from this point
before going back to Milton. They desired to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
see a part of the country altogether strange to
them.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we go around by the Higgins farm
again?”
</p>
<p>
That was the query Neale O’Neil propounded
before bedtime that evening after they had eaten
another of “Mother’s” wonderful suppers.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t really see the use,” Mrs. Heard said.
“I haven’t heard a word from Philly Collinger
about it. And I told him everything that Gypsy
told you, Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“And how Neale hunted in the barn and found
no trace of Mr. Collinger’s car?” suggested Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes.”
</p>
<p>
“But he <em>did</em> find something!” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“What did he find, I’d like to know?” asked her
sister.
</p>
<p>
“He saw where the auto wheels had skidded on
the path going up to the barn—didn’t you, Neale?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” the boy agreed. “But the car wasn’t
there.”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! you didn’t find it,” said the girl scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness, Aggie!” cried Ruth, “when you
set out to be, you can be the most stubborn person!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well,” Mrs. Heard said soothingly, “what
if we do go around by that barn and satisfy Agnes?
It won’t be much out of our way.”
</p>
<p>
It was over a good bit of rough road, however,
and that rough road brought calamity to the Corner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
House car. Neale O’Neil knew something was
wrong before they had climbed the long hill to the
level of the Higgins farm.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that thumping noise, Neale?” asked
the sharp-eared Agnes, who had chosen to ride
with the young chauffeur and Sammy and Tom
Jonah in the front of the machine.
</p>
<p>
Neale was scowling. “Ask me an easier one,”
he growled. “I’m no soothsayer.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! you needn’t be so pie-crusty,” she said.
“Is the car falling to pieces?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe.”
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you stop and find out?”
</p>
<p>
“On this hill? Not much!” declared the boy,
his brow still wrinkled with anxiety.
</p>
<p>
“Well! It’s—go-ing—to—stop!” jerked out
the prophetic Agnes, as the wheels of the rumbling
car seemed to turn more and more slowly.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter?” demanded Ruth, from
the tonneau. “Is the car stopping?”
</p>
<p>
Neale manipulated the levers, and the engine
roared spitefully; but the speed did not increase,
and that sepulchral thumping under the car continued.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you haven’t run out of gasoline again,
Neale?” suggested Mrs. Heard.
</p>
<p>
Neale grunted. Agnes giggled. “My! you
could bite nails, couldn’t you?” she whispered.
</p>
<p>
It was most exasperating—no mistake about it!
The machine had acted so well all along, that perhaps
he had grown careless. Yet Neale could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
imagine what it was that had happened now. And
away out here in the wilderness! He was sure
that rumbling and thumping spelled trouble.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you mean to stop?” gasped Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Not here, I tell you,” snapped the exasperated
youth. “You want us to get stalled here out of
sight of a house, even?”
</p>
<p>
“We won’t be in sight of many houses when we
get to the top of the hill, if I remember rightly,”
murmured Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Neale made no further reply. The thing continued
to thump and the engine to roar. But they
reached the top of the hill and continued staggering
along toward the farm buildings, which looked
as deserted as they had on the previous occasion
when the party had stopped here.
</p>
<p>
“How near are we to a repair garage?” asked
Mrs. Heard.
</p>
<p>
“About twenty miles,” Agnes told her. “Sweet
prospect, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“But what is the matter?” repeated Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“If you ask <em>me</em>,” said Agnes, with conviction,
“I think the old thing has the epizootic.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” gasped Dot. “That’s what the
stableman’s horse had—and it died. Could our
automobile have the same sickness?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know; but it acts as if it were going to
die,” growled Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Shall—shall we get out and walk?” asked Tess.
“Maybe it can’t carry so many now.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear the kid!” scoffed Sammy. “’Tain’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
nothing but an old mess of iron-work. It <em>can’t</em>
get sick.”
</p>
<p>
There certainly was something, however, seriously
the matter with the Corner House girls’
automobile. Just as they came abreast of the
drive that led up to the big hay barn the engine
coughed two or three times, and then stopped dead.
</p>
<p>
“All out!” ejaculated Neale, in disgust. “This
looks like the end of our day’s journey.”
</p>
<p>
“And not a house in sight,” murmured Mrs.
Heard.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—SAMMY INVESTIGATES</h2>
<p>
It was a lovely afternoon, and there were still
two or three hours before sunset. The intention
had been merely to stop at the abandoned Higgins
farm to satisfy Agnes’ desire to make another
search of the premises for the lost motor car.
</p>
<p>
“I believe you wanted to look down the well to
see if it was there,” Neale remarked, grumpily.
“Well! you’ve time enough to do it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! don’t be nasty,” said his girl chum.
“I’m sorry if the old car is going to make you
trouble——”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Us</em> trouble, I should say,” Ruth said, rather
sharply. “Do you realize that we are an unconscionable
long way from civilization?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, don’t let us become savage, if the wilderness
is,” said Mrs. Heard, recovering her own
good temper. “Of course, Neale, you don’t know
just what the matter is with the machine?”
</p>
<p>
“Not yet; but I’m going to find out,” he returned,
hauling his overalls and jumper out of the
tool-box.
</p>
<p>
“And us,” cried Dot. “Let’s look around for
the place where we’re going to camp. Why! we’ll
be just like the Gypsies again.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” groaned Mrs. Heard. “That
child is uncanny. Does she <em>know</em> that we are going
to be marooned here all night? And not a
soul in sight!”
</p>
<p>
“We got something to eat,” said Sammy, who
had investigated. “I’ll get the fire ready to light.
Neale won’t let me have matches.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure we could clean out one of those small
houses, and make it nice and comfortable for us
to live in,” said Tess, falling in with the idea with
enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
“Me for the hay!” cried Agnes, running up to
the barn door. “We’ll sleep in the hay!”
</p>
<p>
“Remember the rats!” hissed Neale, as he crept
under the car with a hammer and a collection of
wrenches.
</p>
<p>
“Mean thing!” cried Agnes. “I won’t believe
there <em>are</em> such things, so now!”
</p>
<p>
When she opened the small barn door, however,
she had a fright right at the start. Something
whisked out at her feet, and Agnes leaped aside
with a scream.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! it’s a pussy-cat,” cried Dot delightedly.
“Then somebody <em>does</em> live here!”
</p>
<p>
It was a beautiful blue Maltese cat, and although
she was a little wild at first, she must have been
used to children when the farmer lived here, for
Dot and Tess soon coaxed her to come to be petted.
</p>
<p>
“Anyway,” Agnes said, “I’m not going to
worry about rats with a fine puss like her around.
<em>She</em> can handle the rats.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sure. She eats ’em alive,” called Neale from
beneath the car.
</p>
<p>
Agnes went inside and struggled with the bar
of the big barn door. Sammy finally went to her
assistance and they swung the doors open so that
the sunlight might flood the interior. Nothing
seemed to be changed since Neale had made his
search more than two weeks before.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Heard and Ruth were wandering about the
premises, looking into the other outbuildings.
The stable was empty, of course. There was no
stock on the place. But on the other side of the
ruins of the burned dwelling they made quite an
important discovery.
</p>
<p>
There was a fenced-in garden patch. It was
weed-grown for the most part; but there were
berry bushes loaded with dew-berries and raspberries,
both black and red; besides ripening
gooseberries and currants. Here was a feast for
the children, and Ruth was about to call them
when Mrs. Heard said:
</p>
<p>
“Wait. If we should have to remain to-night,
this fruit will help out for supper and breakfast.
We have plenty of sugar and canned evaporated
milk.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me, Mrs. Heard! Don’t talk so perfectly
recklessly!” Ruth exclaimed. “It can’t be
that we shall have to remain here. Why, we
<em>can’t</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do—walk to the next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
town?” asked Agnes, who came to them in time
to overhear this statement of her sister’s.
</p>
<p>
“Where is the next town?” asked Mrs. Heard
quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Just sixteen miles away by the map—and fourteen
at least as the crow flies,” Agnes said
promptly.
</p>
<p>
“And we’re not crows,” murmured Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“We can never walk fourteen miles—or more,”
Mrs. Heard said, with conviction. “Where is the
nearest house?”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness only knows. There is no other farm
on this road—we know that. And I don’t remember
seeing any very near to where we turned into
it at either end, do you?” said Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t,” Ruth admitted, shaking her head.
“We <em>are</em> in a fix if Neale can’t repair the car himself—and
quickly.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say anything to him,” begged Agnes.
“He’s as cross as a bear with a sore head.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Mrs. Heard and the two girls were
approaching the automobile.
</p>
<p>
“Ouch!” grunted Neale from under the car, and
Agnes giggled.
</p>
<p>
“Now he’s bumped his poor head again, and
it’s sorer than ever.”
</p>
<p>
They waited for the final verdict—Mrs. Heard
in a serious mind if the girls were not. Finally
Neale backed out from beneath the machine. He
held a casting in his hand, and it was so badly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
cracked that, when he pressed the halves apart, it
broke in two pieces.
</p>
<p>
“There’s the blamed thing!” he pronounced,
with scowling emphasis.
</p>
<p>
“Sh!” exclaimed Ruth. “Don’t use such language.
Can’t it be fixed?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes. They grow these things on bushes
right out yonder in the fields. All I’ve got to do
is to go and pick one that fits this breed of car.
Oh, yes!” retorted Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“It is tragic!” gasped Mrs. Heard.
</p>
<p>
“Then we surely will have to stay here to-night,”
said Agnes, and she did not sound as
though the prospect worried her much.
</p>
<p>
“And to-morrow night—and the next night—and
for several more, if you ask me,” growled
Neale. “That is, unless I can get a wagon and
drive you all to the nearest railroad station, and
send you back to Milton.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Nev-air</em>!” cried Agnes. “Let you stay here
and have all the fun? Stingy!”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness, child,” murmured the chaperone.
“What do you call fun?”
</p>
<p>
“At least, it would be a novel experience,” Ruth
admitted.
</p>
<p>
“You, too?” gasped Mrs. Heard. “I thought
<em>you</em> had better sense, Ruth Kenway.”
</p>
<p>
“Well—I haven’t,” admitted the oldest Corner
House girl, smiling. “How are you going to get
the thing repaired, Neale?”
</p>
<p>
“Wire to the makers. Take two or three days
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
to get the new casting. And we can’t run a yard
without it.”
</p>
<p>
“Where will you send your telegram from?”
Ruth asked.
</p>
<p>
“From the flag station—Hickton—and that’s
seven miles away. I’ll have to walk it unless I
find some one to drive me there.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! To-night?” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“No. Couldn’t get to the station before it was
closed, anyway. I’ll make an early start. That
is, unless you want me to hike right out now and
find a farmer who will cart you all to some place
where you can get regular beds.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no!” cried Agnes, again. “You sha’n’t
have all the fun, Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“No-o, Neale,” said Ruth, more slowly. “I
think it will be possible for us all to stay here with
you. The weather is so nice.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let’s stay! Let’s stay!” cried the three
juveniles in chorus, and even Tom Jonah, becoming
excited too, barked his approval.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what can I do,” Mrs. Heard demanded,
“with every one against me?”
</p>
<p>
So it was agreed to stay. First of all, Neale
declared the car must be got into the barn, for
it might rain; and then, it did not look well to
have the automobile standing out in the open
road.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know who you suppose is going to
see it here?” demanded Agnes, with a sniff. “I
don’t believe anybody ever drives through this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
road more than once a month—or unless there is
a funeral in the family!”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe Saleratus Joe and that other fellow will
be driving through in Mr. Collinger’s runabout,”
said Neale slyly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if they only would!” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“A fat chance!” returned Neale. “And what
if they did? Would you hold ’em up the way that
imitation constable did us, and take the car away
from them?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what I’d do,” said Agnes. “But
I’d do something.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the boy rummaged around in the
barn and found a set of blocks and the necessary
tackle. This he rigged to a beam inside the barn
and carried the rope to the car at the foot of the
sloping driveway.
</p>
<p>
With the purchase this arrangement gave them,
the young folks all “tailed” on to the rope like
sailors and managed to drag the automobile into
the barn; but they were more than an hour and a
half at the work, and it was growing dark when
they finished.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile nobody had appeared to forbid their
camping on the Higgins premises. A fire had been
built in the open and the tripod set up. Mrs.
Heard tucked up her skirts and grilled bacon (and
her face) at the fire. There were eggs, too, and
canned tongue and biscuits and plenty of fruit.
They all thought it great fun.
</p>
<p>
After supper, as it was still too early for bed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
the three children entered into a boisterous game
of hide-and-go-seek. Sammy, burrowing in the
great heap of hay at the rear of the barn floor,
suddenly lost his interest in the game. He
dragged something out of the hay and brought it
to Neale, who sat on the sill of the big door with
pad and pencil, composing the telegram he intended
to send to the automobile manufacturers
from Hickton the next morning.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that you have, Sammy P.?” demanded
Agnes, as the little fellow, too excited to speak,
put the object in Neale’s hands.
</p>
<p>
“Great cracky!” ejaculated Neale O’Neil.
“Where did you get it?”
</p>
<p>
“Under the hay. There’s something there. I
broke the wire that held it—see?” said Sammy,
excitedly.
</p>
<p>
“A license plate!” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“State license number! What do you know
about that? Ask Mrs. Heard——”
</p>
<p>
Agnes was away like the wind. Mrs. Heard and
Ruth were washing dishes at the horse trough.
The girl brought the chaperone in a hurry.
</p>
<p>
“What was Mr. Collinger’s license number, do
you know?” Neale asked her. “I mean his automobile
license number.”
</p>
<p>
“The license number is twenty-four hundred and
thirty-two. Goodness! I ought to remember it.”
</p>
<p>
Neale stood up with the license plate in his
hand. “We’ve found the car, sure as you live!”
he said, with conviction.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—ROUGHING IT</h2>
<p>
Agnes had an excellent opportunity to say “I
told you so!” to Neale; but did not even mention
to her boy chum the fact that he could not have
searched the barn very thoroughly upon his first
visit to the place.
</p>
<p>
For Mr. Collinger’s stolen automobile was there
under the hay. By the light of their own automobile
lanterns Neale uncovered the runabout and
finally hauled it out on the barn floor.
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose is the matter with it?”
asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Why, nothing, of course,” cried Mrs. Heard,
almost in tears, she was so happy. “Philly will
be so delighted.”
</p>
<p>
“Guess I’d better telegraph to him in the morning
when I send for that casting—eh?” said Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! if you will, Neale,” said the chaperone.
“He can come and get the car himself. Oh, dear
me! isn’t this just the finest thing that’s happened
to us during our tour?”
</p>
<p>
“It is, indeed, Mrs. Heard,” Ruth agreed.
</p>
<p>
“And all because of Sammy,” said Neale.
“Sammy, you’re some kid.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of course I am,” agreed that irrepressible.
“I guess you’re all glad <em>now</em> that I came with you,
ain’t you?”
</p>
<p>
There was nothing bashful about Sammy Pinkney.
He demanded and received all the credit
due him.
</p>
<p>
Nor did Agnes and Neale begrudge him the
honor—and certainly not Mrs. Heard. The discovery
of the stolen car was sufficient to make Mrs.
Heard forget their present discomforts; while
Neale and Agnes felt that their suspicions of
Saleratus Joe and the ugly man had been proved
true.
</p>
<p>
“The Gypsy king told us the exact truth,”
Agnes said. “I thought he was an honest man.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” Dot said wonderingly. “Wasn’t
he a <em>king</em>, even if he didn’t wear a crown and carry
a scalper?”
</p>
<p>
“And won’t Philly Collinger be glad? <em>Won’t</em>
he be glad?” Mrs. Heard cried, over and over
again.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Neale was going carefully over the
recovered runabout; but he could not examine it
thoroughly by lantern-light.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, it broke down or something,” he
said. “Or they wouldn’t have abandoned it here.
Just as soon as the farmer came for some of his
hay he’d have found the car. Saleratus Joe
couldn’t have intended to leave it here for long
unless it needed repairing. That is, it doesn’t
seem as if he would.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
“He may come back here—he and the ugly man—<em>any
time!</em>” whispered Agnes in his ear.
</p>
<p>
“Sh! nonsense!” commanded Neale. “Anyway,
we have Tom Jonah. I’ll give the car a thorough
going over when I come back from the railroad
to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
The excitement occasioned by Sammy’s discovery
kept them all awake longer than usual. Besides,
camping out in this way had not become
familiar enough to the party for them to have
become used to it. Only on the night they had remained
with Luke and Cecile Shepard had they
experienced anything at all like this present situation.
</p>
<p>
It was agreed by all that they should bed in the
hay. With robes and dust-cloths from their car
they made themselves very comfortable in the
heaped-up, fragrant mass of dried grass at the
back of the barn.
</p>
<p>
“We are ‘bedding down’ just like cattle,” giggled
Agnes. “Isn’t it fun?”
</p>
<p>
It was very comfortable, whether it was fun or
not, and they soon went to sleep and slept as heavily
as the seven sleepers—whoever they may have
been—until daybreak. Tom Jonah lay at the open
barn door and kept faithful watch.
</p>
<p>
Neale was astir first, and he built a fire and
made coffee. Agnes smelled the coffee, and soon
ran out in her stocking feet with her shoes in her
hand.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” she whispered shrilly. “This is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
the life! Isn’t it just great? I could live this
way always. Where do you wash?”
</p>
<p>
“At the horse-trough,” said the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Oh-o! I don’t like that,” she objected.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me!” responded Neale, in a shrill falsetto,
and grinning at her. “And you could live
this way always!”
</p>
<p>
“Mean thing!” she retorted. “Folks can be
nice if they do live like Gypsies.”
</p>
<p>
“Or hoboes,” added the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Well——”
</p>
<p>
“Pump fresh water for yourself, of course,”
said Neale. “And put on your shoes or you’ll
bruise your feet on these pebbles.”
</p>
<p>
“My, yes! I feel as if I were doing penance,”
confessed Agnes, hastening to pull on her shoes.
</p>
<p>
They had a cozy time drinking the hot coffee
and munching crackers before the others were even
astir.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bring back a lot of grub,” promised Neale.
</p>
<p>
“And a tube of cold-cream; Ruth and I are all
out. And a bottle of witch hazel, and some animal
crackers, because the kids like ’em. And some
hand lotion for Mrs. Heard—I know her bottle is
almost empty. And <em>do</em> get good tea. And don’t
forget the stuffed olives——”
</p>
<p>
“Hold on,” interposed Neale, beginning to count
on his fingers. “Let’s see if I can remember all
those. First, a tub of cold cream——”
</p>
<p>
“Tube! tube!” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Ah! There is a difference, isn’t there?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
he responded, grinning, and named the other articles
over with some exactness. “All right. If
my memory—and my money—doesn’t give out
I’ll bring them all, even if I have to hire a four-horse
wagon to cart the stuff.”
</p>
<p>
He started away at once, and was out of sight
before the rest of the party appeared from the
barn, yawning but deliciously rested. Sweet-smelling
hay for a bed cannot be improved
upon.
</p>
<p>
“Only,” Tess observed, “I don’t feel just right
because I haven’t been all undressed. Don’t you
s’pose, Ruthie, that we could take turns having a
bath in the horse-trough?”
</p>
<p>
The others laughed at her; and it was agreed
that it was not going to be much of a cross, after
all, to remain on the abandoned farm for the few
days it would be necessary to wait for the new
part for the automobile.
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil was two hours in getting to Hickton,
for it was a long seven miles and the roads
were sandy. And along the way he did not pass
a dozen houses, and none of them was very near
to the Higgins farm. Still, it was not later than
eight o’clock when he sent the telegram to the automobile
factory, which was not very far away; and
he ordered the new casting sent C.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;D. to the
Hickton station.
</p>
<p>
Then he telegraphed to Mr. Collinger, at Milton,
in Mrs. Heard’s name. The surveyor’s aunt had
written her message carefully, so that the ordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
reader would not understand just where the stolen
car was. Mr. Collinger was to come to Hickton
and there inquire for the party of motor car tourists.
</p>
<p>
There were two stores in sight of the railway
station, and in them Neale managed to buy enough
food to last his party several days, including eggs
and milk and country butter and cheese.
</p>
<p>
Neale could never have carried all these things
back to the farm, but he found a long-legged boy
with a rattling wagon drawn by a pony, and bargained
with the youth for transportation to the
Higgins farm. When the boy learned that a touring
party was camped at the site of the burned
farmhouse, he was greatly amused.
</p>
<p>
“Guess old man Higgins don’t know about it,
does he?” the lad asked.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t suppose he does,” admitted Neale.
“But we are not doing any harm there.”
</p>
<p>
“He, he! I reckon yer critters won’t eat up
his hay, that’s sure.”
</p>
<p>
“No. Our motive power feeds on gasoline,”
Neale laughed.
</p>
<p>
“By jinks! I s’pose that’s so. But I’ll drive
around to old man Higgins and tell him yer camping
there—jest ter see what he’ll say.”
</p>
<p>
Neale told Mrs. Heard this, and the chaperone
decided to send a note to the owner of the place,
requesting permission to remain at the abandoned
farm and offering to pay for the accommodation
if the owner so desired.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
</p>
<p>
The party was quite settled in the camping
place by this time.
</p>
<p>
“We really <em>are</em> Gypsies,” Mrs. Heard said.
“And I never in my life saw children so delighted
as these of ours are at the present time. Goodness!
they will never want to live properly again.”
</p>
<p>
It was not alone the little folks who fully enjoyed
the situation. Ruth found a big, clean galvanized
iron pail and proceeded to wash all the
clothes that did not need starch and a hot iron.
She had filled a long line before Neale returned
from Hickton.
</p>
<p>
After the noon meal Neale went to work on the
stolen car. He made an important discovery in
a very short time. There was absolutely nothing
the matter with Mr. Collinger’s car, though there
was no gasoline in the tank!
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if those fellows found it out before
they abandoned it here?” Mrs. Heard queried.
</p>
<p>
“Well, if they went away just to get some gas
for it, they’ve been gone a long time,” giggled
Agnes. “But Neale might have saved himself
the walk to Hickton if he’d found this out last
night.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes; if the rabbit hadn’t stopped to take
a nap he’d have won the race over Mr. Tortoise,”
retorted Neale. “We know all about those might-have-beens.”
</p>
<p>
“But—really—I wonder,” said the chaperone
slowly.
</p>
<p>
“You wonder what, Mrs. Heard?” asked Ruth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what became of those maps and
things that Philly was so careful of. If they were
in the car——”
</p>
<p>
“Then Saleratus Joe got ’em,” said Neale
promptly.
</p>
<p>
“No. I don’t believe the politicians who instigated
the robbery have obtained what they hoped
to find in this car. I—wonder—where—they—are.”
</p>
<p>
“Not in the gasoline tank, that’s sure,” said
Neale. “I looked in it.”
</p>
<p>
They all laughed at that, and Mrs. Heard abandoned
the puzzling subject.
</p>
<p>
There was nothing to do of importance but to
wait for the message from the automobile factory.
Neale tried out the car that had been stolen from
Mrs. Heard’s nephew and Mrs. Heard herself enjoyed
a ride in it. It was a very good car indeed,
and beautifully upholstered.
</p>
<p>
“I know Philly told me he had this car built
according to his own plans, and I’ve wondered
since if he didn’t have a place built in it in which
to hide his private papers,” Mrs. Heard said. “It
would be just like him.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! wouldn’t that be great?” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“And then maybe the maps and things are in
the car,” Ruth said.
</p>
<p>
“Who knows? I am quite confident, because of
what my nephew said, that the bundle the thieves
got in the car was worthless. I remember his saying:
’Those rascals won’t get what they want unless they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
tear my car to pieces.’ Now, what could
he have meant by <em>that</em>?”
</p>
<p>
The problem interested the older Corner House
girls and Neale very much. Agnes examined the
upholstering and the panel-work of the runabout
very closely.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps Saleratus Joe did find the papers.
That’s why the car was abandoned here,” she said
to Neale, with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
“Well, if they found the secret panel,” said the
boy, grinning, “they didn’t leave it open so we
could find it, did they?”
</p>
<p>
“You needn’t make fun,” said Agnes. “If I
find the papers I won’t tell you—so now!”
</p>
<p>
“Help yourself,” he returned. “I’m not half
so much interested in Mr. Collinger’s affairs as I
am in our own car. I hope the factory hustles
that casting right along.”
</p>
<p>
They could not expect it yet, and the remainder
of the day was spent in roaming about the farm.
The children found the biggest huckleberry pasture
any of them had ever seen. Mrs. Heard’s
housewifely desires were spurred.
</p>
<p>
“I do wish these berries were near Milton,” she
declared. “I’d can enough of them to last the
winter through for huckleberry pies.”
</p>
<p>
They were getting supper, Gypsy fashion, when
the lanky boy with the pony drove up with the
answers to the telegrams Neale had sent that
morning from the Hickton station.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah!” shouted Neale, the moment he read
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
his message. “The thing is already shipped.
When does the first train from the south stop at
Hickton in the morning?” he asked the messenger.
</p>
<p>
“Eight-thirty,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“It will be on that. I’ll run over in Mr. Collinger’s
car and get it.”
</p>
<p>
“And Philly says he’ll come up here some time
to-morrow, too,” announced Mrs. Heard. “We
sha’n’t have to live in a barn but one night more.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, say!” drawled the country lad. “Old
man Higgins says you kin stay here as long as ye
want to, if ye don’t burn up the rest o’ the buildings.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING</h2>
<p>
A very red-faced sun awoke the touring party
the next morning, his first rays shooting directly
into the broad doorway of the barn—an intruder
that Tom Jonah, faithful watchman as he was,
could not keep out. The sunshine shone directly
into the eyes of the Corner House girls and their
friends.
</p>
<p>
All were quickly astir. They expected to be on
their way again before night; and although roughing
it had been fun, there were some drawbacks
to it.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll sleep in regular beds again to-night,”
Agnes said, with some satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t believe it will be half so nice,” Tess
observed. “This hay is so sweet and smelly.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Sammy Pinkney!” cried Dot, suddenly
spying that youngster in mischief, “don’t pull
that nice pussy’s tail. It hurts her.”
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t pulling her tail,” replied Sammy
promptly. “I’m only holding her tail. The cat’s
doing all the pulling.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes bore down upon him and he immediately
ceased holding poor pussy’s tail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
“Say! you’re awful particular,” complained the
boy. “I wasn’t really hurting the old cat, Aggie.
And—and it ain’t polite to always be interferin’
with a feller.”
</p>
<p>
“Now you’ve got it, Aggie,” chuckled Neale
O’Neil. “You see you’re not polite. And politeness
costs nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! doesn’t it?” returned Agnes. “Suppose
you’d put ‘very respectfully yours’ at the end of
that telegram you sent to the auto factory? I
guess you’d have found it cost something.”
</p>
<p>
“Stung again!” admitted Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Why, what is all this I hear?” demanded
Ruth, coming up from the horse trough pump bearing
a brimming pail of water. “Did somebody
get out of bed on the wrong side this bright and
beautiful morning?”
</p>
<p>
“It was the cat,” said Neale, in a sepulchral
voice. “<em>She</em> started it.”
</p>
<p>
“Which side is the wrong side of a hay-mow
bed, Ruthie?” Tess asked.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a poser,” Neale said. “You’ll have
to ask somebody else about that, eh, Ruth? Now,
hustle along the breakfast, you girls, for I must
start for Hickton.”
</p>
<p>
“And I’m going with you, Neale,” Agnes declared.
“You can speed up that runabout as fast
as you want to. The others won’t be along to
object.”
</p>
<p>
This last remark she whispered in Neale’s ear.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you, Aggie, you’re a speed maniac,” responded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
Neale. “But if Mrs. Heard says you
may go off alone with me, all right.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes had learned by this time to wheedle the
good-natured chaperone into agreeing to almost
anything the girls desired; and of course she had
no objection to Agnes’ going anywhere with Neale.
Whether the Corner House girls realized it or not,
they could not have had a brother any more careful
for them or better to them than Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
So the girl and boy chums were on the road in
the runabout soon after eight. Mr. Collinger’s
was a good machine, and it ran smoothly. But
Agnes suddenly had an unhappy thought.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” she said, clasping her hands.
</p>
<p>
“Shoot!” advised the boy, with his eyes on the
road ahead.
</p>
<p>
“We’re riding in a stolen car.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure we are. What of it?”
</p>
<p>
“And all the constables and sheriffs and policemen
all over the State have the description of this
car and her license number. What are you going
to do if an officer holds us up?”
</p>
<p>
“Cracky! never thought of it,” admitted the
boy. “I expect they’ll jail us.”
</p>
<p>
“Horrid thing! But we <em>may</em> have an unpleasant
time explaining it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, let us hope nothing like that occurs,” he
said; but Agnes was troubled by the possibility of
arrest all the way to the station and back again.
</p>
<p>
The casting was waiting for them and Neale paid
the expressman and then the runabout was headed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
for the Higgins farm. As Neale and Agnes came
in view of the farm buildings none of their party
was in sight; but coming across a distant field
were two men who seemed to be carrying something
heavy between them.
</p>
<p>
“First natives we’ve seen wandering around
here,” Neale observed. “And where are the
folks?”
</p>
<p>
“All gone berrying,” Agnes replied. “They
said they were going to fill every receptacle we
have before leaving the Higgins place. I never
<em>did</em> see so many berries.”
</p>
<p>
Neale ran the runabout up to the barn, but did
not drive it inside. The big doors had been closed
and their own car stood within on the barn floor,
but out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go berrying too, just as soon as I slip
this thing into place,” Neale suggested.
</p>
<p>
Although the broken casting had caused so
much trouble, it did not take five minutes to put
the new one into place. He tried the engine, and
everything worked well.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” he announced, coming out of the
small door of the barn again. “Shall we chase
over after the others?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. And tell them it’s all right. We can
start off any time now,” Agnes said.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo! I guess we’ll have to wait for Mr.
Collinger to show up for his car.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me, yes. I did not think of that,”
Agnes returned. “I—I wish Mrs. Heard hadn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
telegraphed for him. Then we could have driven
his car to Milton with ours too. <em>I</em> could have
driven it.”
</p>
<p>
“No license, Aggie,” said Neale. “You can’t
drive a car. Say! did you see that?”
</p>
<p>
“See what, Neale?” she asked him, looking all
around.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I saw a man slip behind that far
shed.”
</p>
<p>
“Why! what’s become of those two men we saw
crossing the field yonder?” demanded the girl,
with interest.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they must have reached the road by this
time,” and Neale went on again. “I guess we
needn’t bother about them.”
</p>
<p>
But after a moment he said, in a puzzled tone:
“That fellow dodged behind the shed as though
he did not want to be seen. Funny——”
</p>
<p>
“They might steal some of our things,” Agnes
said. “We ought not to leave the place unguarded.
Come on back, Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“Well—maybe you are right,” admitted the boy.
“Though probably they are harmless folks.”
</p>
<p>
“They could steal the automobiles,” declared
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t work yourself up into a conniption
fit,” chuckled Neale. “You think everybody you
see is an automobile thief.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! what’s that?”
</p>
<p>
The sudden sputtering of an engine was audible.
Somebody was trying the starter of the runabout
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
they had left standing in the shade before the
barn.
</p>
<p>
“Fooling with it, of course!” muttered Neale,
starting to run.
</p>
<p>
“They are stealing it!” whispered Agnes, determined
to believe the worst.
</p>
<p>
It seemed as though, on this occasion, Agnes
was right. As they dashed around the corner of
the stable and reached the open yard, the runabout
began to “chug-chug” regularly, and they saw it
being steered out of the Higgins premises.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, there! Stop!” yelled Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” wailed Agnes. “It’s that Saleratus
Joe and the ugly man.”
</p>
<p>
She was correct. The freckled-faced fellow
who had been Mr. Jim Brady’s chauffeur was driving
the re-stolen automobile, while the ugly man
sat beside him. The latter turned around and
laughed at the excited boy and girl as the runabout
swerved into the road and took the direction
of the railroad at a fast clip.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! what will Mrs. Heard say?”
gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“What will Mr. Collinger say? That’s more to
the point,” growled Neale. “Who would have
thought that those fellows were around here?
And there’s the can they brought with them.
Gasoline, of course. They didn’t have to use it,
for the tank of the runabout is nearly full.”
</p>
<p>
“What <em>shall</em> we do, Neale?” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Neale was practical, when once he recovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
from his first amazement. He dashed into the
barn and swung open the big doors.
</p>
<p>
“They didn’t see our car,” he cried. “And let
me tell you they can’t get away from it. I can
drive our car much faster than they can run that
little one—believe me!”
</p>
<p>
He tried the starter, glanced into the gas tank,
and then got in behind the steering wheel.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Neale O’Neil!” cried Agnes. “You’re
not going alone—not much!”
</p>
<p>
As the car started she swung herself aboard.
Neale said, hastily:
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about your going with me, Aggie.
There may be trouble——”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care. I’m going,” she said, with determination.
“I wouldn’t miss this for a farm!”
</p>
<p>
“Hang on!” he cried, as the big car rumbled out
of the barn.
</p>
<p>
The mechanism worked all right, and when they
turned into the road the stolen motor car was not
yet out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“And we won’t let it get out of sight,” Neale
declared. “I just wish we’d run into that Sheriff
Keech again. But he lives a long way from
here.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Neale!” laughed his girl companion, “he
isn’t even sheriff over here. Don’t you remember
that we’re in another county now?”
</p>
<p>
“Cracky! I’d forgotten that. Well, we’ve got
no pull with the officers of the law in this county,
perhaps; but neither has Saleratus Joe. I’m going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
hang right to those fellows until there’s a
chance of getting them arrested.”
</p>
<p>
For once Agnes was satisfied with the speed of
the car. It roared along the road, jolting over
the uneven spots, thundering over a wooden bridge
which spanned a creek, finally shooting into the
main highway to the railroad station, not a hundred
yards behind the stolen car.
</p>
<p>
By this time the ugly man, who often looked
around, was not laughing at the Corner House
girl and her companion. Without doubt Saleratus
Joe was driving the runabout at top speed; but
the small car did not have the powerful engine
that had been built into the larger car.
</p>
<p>
They passed nobody on the road—no vehicle at
least. And that was a good thing, too; for almost
any horse would have been frightened by the onrush
of the two cars.
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose they mean to do?
Where are they going?” shouted Agnes in Neale’s
ear.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t the least idea,” returned the boy.
“But I know what <em>I’m</em> going to do.”
</p>
<p>
“What is that?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Hang to ’em! Hang just like a bulldog to a
tramp’s coat-tail,” declared Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
At that moment the little station at Hickton
came into sight. There were two men, talking excitedly,
standing directly in the middle of the highway,
and, when they sighted these two men, the
thieves in the runabout slowed down.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—WELCOME HOME</h2>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” gasped Agnes, hanging to his
arm as the big car came roaring down to the Hickton
railway station. “Oh, Neale! that’s that horrid
Brady man.”
</p>
<p>
It was plain to be seen that one of the men in
the middle of the road was the Milton politician,
Jim Brady. But the other man——
</p>
<p>
“It’s the surveyor. I know him,” whispered
Neale, shutting off the engine. “Mr. Philip Collinger,
Mrs. Heard’s nephew. It’s all over now
but the shouting, Aggie. I bet he doesn’t let that
car of his get away again.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the two men from Milton had stopped
the runabout, and the freckled-faced fellow and
the ugly man with him were caught, red-handed.
</p>
<p>
“Get out of my car!” Neale and Agnes heard
Mr. Collinger command the two rascals. “I’d
like to know how you got it again? I know that
it was in the hands of friends of mine yesterday.
This henchman of yours, Brady, is a born thief.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s a born fool,” growled the fat man, mopping
his bald brow and glaring at the cringing
Joe.
</p>
<p>
The other fellow was quietly slipping around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
corner of the railroad station. He was not going
to be present during this altercation.
</p>
<p>
“He’s something besides a fool,” said Mr. Collinger
sternly. “It’s <em>you</em>, Brady, who have shown
a lack of wit. I know very well you put this fellow
up to taking my car because you thought I was
carrying those road maps around in it.”
</p>
<p>
“You think a whole lot, Collinger,” snarled the
big man. “But you can’t prove a thing.”
</p>
<p>
“No. Not unless Joe, here, turns state’s evidence,
and he wouldn’t dare do that. I know the
sort of hold you have on such fellows, Brady. But,
nevertheless, <em>you</em> are the goat in this matter.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” queried the politician.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Collinger went to his car, drawing a bunch
of keys from his pocket as he did so. He selected
a flat key and quickly inserted it in a tiny aperture
in the face-panel of the seat—an aperture
that the uninitiated would never dream was a keyhole.
</p>
<p>
To the amazement of all, the county surveyor
slipped aside the panel and displayed a shallow
closet filled with rolls of parchment.
</p>
<p>
“Just what I thought, Brady,” he said, with
scorn. “You had ’em in the stolen auto all the
time. Now the time has come to deliver them to
the commission and I sha’n’t carry them any more.
Now, who was the fool, Brady?”
</p>
<p>
But the big man was stamping away to the platform.
Saleratus Joe slunk after him like a
whipped cur.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
</p>
<p>
“You are two of the young folks my aunt is
traveling with, I take it?” said Mr. Collinger, turning
to Neale and Agnes. “And I guess you were
chasing those fellows.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Mr. Collinger,” Agnes said. “And they
would not have got away from us.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure they would not,” he returned, smiling.
“Tell me about it.”
</p>
<p>
So the story was told, and then Mr. Collinger
decided to drive back to the Higgins place and
see Mrs. Heard before starting for Milton. He
was warm in his praise of the Corner House girls
and Neale, as well as of Sammy Pinkney, for what
they had done toward aiding him in securing the
car.
</p>
<p>
The girls did not understand fully the reasons
underlying the stealing of the runabout, or why
Mr. Collinger did not intend to prosecute Jim
Brady and the freckled-faced man.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t make anything out of it,” the surveyor
said. “And I have the car back and, best
of all, the maps and papers they wanted to get
from me. I am satisfied.”
</p>
<p>
He remained to dinner with the touring party,
and then started back for Milton. But it was not
the intention of the Corner House girls and their
party to go home immediately.
</p>
<p>
They spent four more days on the road—days
of pure delight for all the Kenway sisters, for
even Sammy behaved well during that part of the
tour.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
</p>
<p>
Yet, after all, they were glad to get home when
the car rolled up to the Willow Street gate of the
Stower homestead. Mrs. MacCall and Linda ran
out of the gate to welcome them. Uncle Rufus
hobbled around from the garden, swinging his tattered
straw hat and cheering. Even Aunt Sarah
Maltby appeared on the porch to welcome somewhat
grimly her nieces and Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
Then, from across the street came Mrs. Pinkney,
with a delighted scream of welcome.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sammy! How you’ve grown!” she declared,
when she had hugged and kissed the would-be
pirate, and then stood off to look at him.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! that’s Ruth’s fault,” he said. “She
made me wash so often. You know, watering
things like that is what makes ’em grow.”
</p>
<p>
“This Corner House is the loneliest place in the
world without you lassies in it,” declared Mrs.
MacCall, having hugged the four girls in rotation,
and then started all over again.
</p>
<p>
Aunt Sarah expressed herself as glad to see her
nieces again. “As long as you haven’t been killed
in that automobile, I presume we should all be
thankful,” she said. “But I did not expect to see
you all return with whole bones.”
</p>
<p>
“And one time, when me and Tess were lost, and
before we found the Gypsies,” confessed Dot, “I
thought that funny bone in my back <em>was</em> broke,
Aunt Sarah. But it got mended again.”
</p>
<p>
There was a regular “party” of all the Corner
House girls’ young friends soon after their return,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
and the adventures of the tour by automobile
were related to everybody.
</p>
<p>
Ruth could remember all about the beautiful
scenery they saw and the queer old inns they
stopped at. She really had gained much entertainment
from the trip.
</p>
<p>
Agnes’ mind was full of the incidents of the
stolen automobile, and how it had been found, and
how she and Neale had chased the thieves to the
Hickton station where the car was captured. To
hear her tell it, it had been a most exciting time.
</p>
<p>
Dot’s mind seemed full of the Gypsies and her
adventures with Tess when they were lost and had
slept all night under a tree. “And that old owl
that shouted at us and wanted to know our names,”
she said. “Just as plain as could be, he hollered:
‘Who? Who? Who?’”
</p>
<p>
But Tess was thoughtful. Somebody asked her
what she was thinking of.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I’ll tell you,” said the next to the smallest
Corner House girl. “I can’t get over Neale
being so—so <em>stingy</em>. I’ve asked him, and I’ve
asked him, and he just <em>won’t</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“He won’t what?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, he won’t tell me what he whispered into
the ear of Mrs. Heard’s brown pony to make him
go. And I think he might!”

Elizabeth Ann is a little girl whom we first meet on a big train,
travelling all alone. Her father and mother have sailed for
Japan, and she is sent back East to visit at first one relative’s
home, and then another. Of course, she meets many new friends,
some of whom she is quite happy with, while others—but you must
read the stories for yourself. Every other girl who reads the
first of these charming books will want all the rest; for
Elizabeth Ann is certainly worth the cultivating.

This charming story is concerned with the fortunes of a little
girl whom a whim of Fate has placed in charge of a woman and her
lame husband living on the New England coast—the Winkiepaw
pair—and the woman, whom Hat May always looks upon as a cruel
ogress of her imaginary fairy world, treats her very badly
indeed.
</p>
<p>
The story covering Hat May’s doings is everything that a book for
girls between the ages of eight and fourteen should be. The
characters are skillfully drawn and true to nature; also while
there is considerable pathos connected with the ill-treatment of
Hat May; so too there is discovered in the telling an abundance
of childish and delightful humor.

Summer has come again to Carey Hill bringing
with it the “rusticators,” or, as the Carey children
are called, the “rusty-cats.” With them comes happiness
to Hat May the little enchanted princess, and
hope of recovery to her little crippled friend, Hank.
The mystic rites of The Seven Bloody Bones baffle
prying Mrs. Winkiepaw who is forced to grant more
freedom to her slave, Hat May. The success of
Ariel’s wonderful play, written especially for the
Seven, buys a wheel-chair for Hank, and then when
the summer is over, and life with the ogress becomes
too hard to bear, Phin cleverly rescues Hat May and
defeats the ill-tempered ogress. Can anyone guess
the beautiful word which disenchants Hat May and
takes her from her dreary and sordid existence to
one of beauty and happiness?

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
